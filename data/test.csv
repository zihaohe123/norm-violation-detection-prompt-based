Q29 from test3 and Q26 from test1 seem to be following the same concept (no?) but have different answers. Why?', 'This is a really tough one, but in fact there are different concepts going on in these two questions. With colons on the SAT, the structure before the colon needs to stand alone as a complete sentence, and the colon shouldn\'t separate two elements that are grammatically linked.\n\nThat\'s why you should **never** put a colon after ""such as."" ""As"" (in this case) is a preposition, and whatever comes after it will be the object of the proposition. You shouldn\'t separate a preposition from its object. Likewise, you should never put a colon after ""including,"" because then you will be separating a verb from its direct object.\n\nThus the colon in #26 is wrong. What comes before the colon could not stand alone, and the colon separates the preposition from its object.\n\n\\#29 is a different story. ""For instance"" is more like a transition phrase or conjunctive adverb, such as ""however"" or ""therefore."" The stuff in front of that colon *could* stand alone as a complete sentence. ""Take Bartlett pears, for instance."" It\'s a command (that\'s why there doesn\'t appear to be a subject for the verb ""take"") and it\'s a little funny to have the transition phrase ""for instance"" at the *end* of the sentence when it\'s really indicating a transition from the *previous* sentence. But all those characteristics, while a little unusual, are not wrong.\n\nIn #29, the stuff before the colon could stand as a complete sentence, and the stuff after it could as well. That\'s perfectly fine. People often associate colons with lists, but don\'t forget that they are allowed to join complete sentences as well.\n\nEdit: clarity', 'Omg. You helped me a lot!!

It\'s weak a sovereignty that can\'t even naturalize citizens and creates difficulties repatriating them. That system is deeply Anti-Indian and Anti-Black; I\'ve seen it at the threshold level as implemented in creating base rolls with BIA-OFA.\n\nThe article itself mentions EVERYTHING else about Roanhorse BUT her Blackness, which she distinctly identifies with. Indians with Black Heritage are absolutely made to comply with higher standards that even Whiter Indians are not. This is a masterclass in all of that.\n\nThe Roanhorse critics are professionally jealous of her success and poison her reputation in her Tribal Community. \n\nThe Feds have done enough damage to Indian Country. Clamoring for even more federal intervention, say nothing of this *vigilante action* by Critics who ARE NOT working on behalf of a Tribal Governments but USURP its authority and call it ""Sovereignty,"" makes things orders worse.\n\nLastly, how the hell do you compare Warren\'s Box-Checking to the challenges facing ADOPTEES.

This includes seasons (Advent, Christmastide, Lent, etc.) and feast days (The Transfiguration, St John the Apostle, etc.).

Biggest glaring flaws right now are performance, little mission variety, and sometimes wonky targeting. Smaller nitpicks would be soldier customization isn't anywhere near the level of modern XCOM, so you can't grow too attached to them. But since it is not an AAA game, I am not too nitpicky.

The good points would the ballistics system. Cover is about actual physical cover and it's durability. Accuracy narrows the shot reticle instead of arbitrary %. 

Heck, the Chiron in my third attempt appeared with some sort of grenade mutation which it can lob at a massive range for massive damage. Solution? Run into a building and it basically became useless, as it has no way to hurt me. Of course, being basically constrained to staying within that building added another challenge. 

Going to enemy mutations, each enemy type can basically have it's own loadout - the mutations. Arthrons, the basic enemy, can have a combination of melee claw or gatling gun in one arm, shield or grenade launcher in another. Presumably, enemy nests dictate the dominant mutation, and the enemy adapts mutations to your playstyle, but I cannot confirm that.

I have not made it very far story and tech wise, so I can't comment  on that progression yet.

Our current regional grid architectures are already big, brittle, high-surface, and high-value, soft targets and hard enough to defend as is. Merging it all together would be suicide.\n\nImagine even a small scale coordinated attack on the scale of 9/11 with such a grid but instead of the buildings it's on a handful of remote HVDC switch yards in flyover country. The entire continent would lose power for weeks while the links are deenergized and emergency repairs made. Think of the human cost of half a billion people loosing reliable power for months on end. Rolling blackouts would cause massive food spoilage, loss of transportation, and climate control induced deaths depending on season/region. And if the attack is big enough to exhaust equipment reserves how are we going to produce new ones without power?\n\n!ping eco"", ""That makes no sense. The whole point of a smart grid is that it's SMART, which means it can self-balance responsively and locally in the case of adverse grid conditions.  **If you have decentralized storage and generation, the end result is likely MORE resilient than our conventional, heavily centralized powergrid.**  Smart grids usually incorporate demand-side response as well, where things like HVAC can shut off if the grid is overloaded.   Natural disruptions (line breaks, storms, animal damage, etc) to the grid are actually quite common, and these responses would help avoid disruptions from those. \n\n[Tesla's Big Battery in Australia has already helped stabilized the local grid several times in response to disruptions from things like lightning strikes](https://reneweconomy.com.au/tesla-big-batterys-stunning-interventions-smooths-transition-to-zero-carbon-grid-35624/). \n\nIndustrial control systems for existing powerplants are a FAR more likely a target due to old software and in some cases known vulnerabilities. This could do considerable physical damage potentially as well as triggering cascading impacts on the surrounding grid.  Heck, the existing grid is very susceptible to cascading outages because it's so centralized.  Look up [The Northeastern blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) and the [Great Northeastern blackout of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_1965).\n\nIn fact, hacking a nuclear powerplant with digital controls has potential to cause far more disasterous and expensive damage than anything you could do via smart grid attacks..."", ""Tesla's grid stabilization is on the order of minutes and completely irrlevant.\n\nSmart grid would help sigificantly of course but it ignores the ecnoomic impact, industrial activities that require sustained power, which may itself be the objective.\n\nWRT electronic warfware, I think that's largely an orthogonal issue as smart girds would present an even larger surface and potential for adversarial loads in addtion to generation and distribution capacity.

Furthermore, the need to be continuously communicating implies security baked-in-by-design, unlike conventional powerplants where they may be completely exposed if the airgap is compromised by (for example) some foolish person breaking policy and connecting a device they should not. \n\nThis is not a theoretical problem, it\'s a very real one.  **[Russia has actually hacked nuclear powerplants and the powergrid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/us/politics/energetic-bear-russian-hackers.html)**.\n\n**With the current dumb-grid, if a large powerplant, say one of the nuclear reactors, suddenly cut its power output or ramped up dramatically there is a very real possibility of bringing down a large area for an extended period and potentially even damaging the lines if grid operators do not respond fast enough to compensate.**  The current grid is brittle as heck.', '>\tThat\'s laughably false.

Also, there is research that shows crop yields are expected to go down in the coming years due to effects coming from and contributing towards climate change.

And the reason I emphasize sustainability in crop production is that our system that has emphasized profits as the number one priority has created conflicts where the constant farming of degenerative crops and an overfarming of the land as a whole has allowed caused the climate to change and cause suffering for almost everyone and everything. Things like soil degradation and aquifer overutilization have led to certain ecoregions becoming desertified which in conjunction with the new pollutants put in the air from all the shipping we do of these far-flung crops, only further causes temperatures to rise. And worse yet, their temperature increases are what lead to lower crop yields because crops stop maturing due to worsened droughts.

This level of farming has degraded the land, poisoned the water, changed our climates, and all because our priority is profits not impact. But there is still hope. Growing crops closer to the consumer and grown with other crops nearby or in rotation can reduce the impacts of farming. These are real, tangible goals that are beginning to be implemented but one of the first steps we have to take to implement more sustainable farming would be to transition away from farming that seeks to create crops for speculative profit-based markets.

And to your second point, I didn't mean preserve in the sense of canning goods, I meant to stop the overproduction of crop goods through subsidized farming that are harmful to the environment, things like unnecessary additives in foods, things like corn, soy, and wheat are grown on their current scale are only used to substitute already unhealthy foods. We have to switch away from excess crop production where the goal is to lobby for increased usage and transition to some kind of subsistence-based farming where we focus on creating what we need and what is essential, not just what is most profitable.",Quality,off-topic,True

Worse yet, I hear that Starship might not be able to dock with the ISS... this would just be the icing on the cake of Starship's complete and utter failure IMO... I'm already setting my expectations low, but if Starship can't dock with the ISS, who cares about Starship at that point? I mean really? It would be useless for 90% of human spaceflight endeavors at that point!... Starship isn't even Shuttle 2.0 at that point... it's just some useless LEO dump truck that's only really good for Starlink Sats and just about nothing else!!!

For the next 10 years all Starship is going to be doing is putting up Starlink Sats and \\~MAYBE\\~ landing humans on the Moon... It absolutely MUST dock with the ISS in my opinion during this time, or the entire Starship program in my view is a complete and utter failure!...   \n\n\nTo that End...

Even in a fully expendable configuration, it will be useful in cost-effective deployment of 100+ ton payloads to LEO. If they can make it reusable or able to dock with the ISS, so much the better. If they human-rate it for operation between Earth and LEO, or LEO to lunar orbit, awesome. etc. etc. It doesn\'t have to succeed in all of these things to be useful.

For starters, if  Starship did actually need hundreds of tons of water, I imagine they'd  launch it without the water, then send up a few tankers with 100+ tons  of water each. I'm pretty sure that if they can figure out how to  transfer cryogenic liquid between vehicles in orbit, they can figure out  how to transfer water.

Band-aid solution... not really practical for Mars colonization... not really practical in general... how much weight can Starship land with? I don't think it's more then 200 Tons... and I know you can't send much more then that to mars...

&gt;Also, how are other potential Mars-bound vehicles intending to deal with  radiation? Will they also carry hundreds of tons of water? If not, what  will they be doing to mitigate radiation, and why will that approach  not work with Starship? Kinda feels like you made a strawman.

The radiation shielding needed for going to Mars doesn't really exists yet... this is pretty much the entire point of Orion, it's a legitimate research program to try and find answers to these questions...

And how is it that you  can have such a high opinion of NASA engineers when it comes to  programs like SLS, and simultaneously believe that some random folks on  the Internet know more about orbital docking?

I understand the engineering problem enough to see why it's a problem... all the extra weight of Starship acts like a pendulum... anyone ever have the Kraken destroy their Space Station in KSP? This is usually why.... in order for it to work Station will really need to dock with Starship, and Staship will need to do all of Stations maneuvering burns for it... Raptor is wayy--- too powerful for that, but those Mini-Raptors for Lunaship will hopefully be able to do it... still that means they will need a specialized version of Starship just for docking with the ISS...

&gt;Except for the other month when he tried to estimate the cost of any  given rocket by multiplying the cost of its propellant by 200, a number  he arrived on by looking at a single rocket.

OMG, you mean because SpaceX doesn't give us any info on the true cost of Starship, so as he said in the video he had to come up with his own method? And even mentioned in the video it was not the best, but it was the best he's got? Also is trusting ULA considered disinformation around here?

&gt;feel really weird talking about Starship

Starship is the reason every Musk Fanboy says SLS should be canceled... to NOT compare the two programs is disingenuous... but the fact of the matter is Starship has TON's to prove before it ever matches SLS in it's capabilities... this fact should be more apparent, but when you have Elon constantly making outlandish claims, and nobody refuting them... you end up with a lot of Toxic fanboys who think they know things...",Be civil,incivility,True

If people aren\'t hostile to Wabbajack why are they hostile to an automated USLEEP installer? If the complaint is that it doesn\'t work with MO2 there are ways around that using the other mirrors.

Uber, Lyft, etc, promised Prop 22 would do the following:

- Pay competitive living wage (~120% minimum wage)

- Give their contractors health benefits

- Healthy worker's comp program

- Prices won't go up.

What actually happened:

- Due to hidden fees and ""downtime"" (you know, because they're contractors and not employees), the average driver makes about $5.64 an hour, or 43% of minimum wage.

- About 75% of drivers don't qualify for any health benefits.

- Their workers comp program falls well short of the states required minimum for employees (good thing they're contractors).

- Prices went up from just about every app-based ride share company since the proposition passed.

So, they spent $200 million on an ad campaign of lies and got exactly what they paid for: A bunch of uninformed voters who accidentally voted to help corporations and screw the people. All with zero consequences/ramifications.

g8vdpcp,SurvivingMyInfidelity,"[""I'm new here..."", 'Hi OP - welcome to the club to which none of us ever thought we’d belong. You’ll find all kinds of advice here.\n\nOne thing that has been helpful to me over the past several months (in IC since Jan, dday was in July) has been digging into what are core beliefs I have that made me feel like my needs could or would not be met in my marriage. Below those are emotional triggers from earlier in my life that reinforce these core beliefs and trigger an addictive response in me.\n\nThe more I’ve dug into these and found what is really at the heart of me - insecurity, shame, fear, poor communication - the more I’m finding I can look for resources to help me.\n\nAt the beginning of my recovery I only thought I was “horny” and my wife was just not sexual enough. I know now I confused pain and shame for being horny and I used sex as a tool to cope, much like an alcoholic or drug addict and would use their substance of choice.\n\nYou may not be a sex addict but my guess is you identify with some of my words so perhaps digging into those beliefs with your own counselor and in your own reflections could lead you on a deeper path of understanding and recovery. Good luck. This is overall a good community who are happy to share wisdom with you and help point out errors in logic. Keep coming back!', 'Thank you for this, I definitely do identify with many of your statements. I started IC last week and honestly I think that\'s what is triggering me wanting to get things out. We have not been to MC, and I\'m not sure he\'ll ever want to do that, although I\'m slowly convincing him of the benefits of IC. Since DDay I think we\'ve both been wanting to move on and pretend nothing ever happened, but that\'s just not possible. He is often triggered by TV shows, commercials, comedians, songs...etc... and it feels like we are back at DDay again.   \n\n\nNow,  ""what are core beliefs I have that made me feel like my needs could or would not be met in my marriage"" is a little tricky for me to approach because I\'m still at a place where I feel like  I am the rotten core that will fester our relationship and he is an innocent. This might not be completely true, he has faults as well as I, but mine are greater. What needs was I not getting? Excitement?!? How embarrassing it is to admit that...', 'First you aren’t rotten to your core. You have some broken beliefs and you made really terrible choices. Your actions are not you AND a you have the opportunity to change and become better through good actions from here out.\n\nSecond, it is helpful if we focus on the impact our choices had to our spouse. If we get stuck feeling sorry for ourselves we can overlook how bad they feel. Doing our work and being there to listen to what we have done to them is what we need to do. It’s ok to feel bad about yourself but just be sure it doesn’t get in the way of the fact above - you get a chance to change and that is helpful to you and to your BS.\n\nThird, yes new and different is exciting. But likely there is something deeper. Excitement can come from our current partners, too, but we chose to get the excitement elsewhere. Why? Why couldn’t we ask our partner for what we wanted? Were we afraid?\n\nMy example is this: I was addicted to pornography for a very long time. It escalated from simple sexual subjects to much more. Heading into the relationship, I already had curiosity about other men in a sexual nature. I was so ashamed of this. I thought to myself “if I tell her she will be so disgusted” and “it is so out of left field. It relates to literally nothing we have ever discussed”. So I had this shameful secret and I what did I do? I acted out through video chats and sexual activity outside my marriage. That led to more shame. That led to more acting out... there is a cycle. Was it exciting to meet a random partner for taboo sexual activity? A bit. Was it dangerous? Very.\n\nNow what if I had shared with my partner? Perhaps she could do nothing about this. Perhaps she would have wanted to do some kind of role play. Perhaps she would have supported me exploring in front of her. Or perhaps she would have said she wasn’t ok with it and we would have discussed that It will be a boundary for me and when the thoughts come up, I will tell her about it but I won’t act on them.\n\nSo many scenarios could have existed but weren’t possible because I never shared. Now that I have shared we still haven’t talked about what to do, but I feel free. I have no secrets left. It is amazing. Someday we will figure it out but the shame cycle is broken for now - as long as I keep no more secrets.\n\nThere are other examples that aren’t as extreme (dominance and submission, risky scenarios, etc) that all were desirable, too btw. I’m not suggesting that only if you have some extreme desire does this cycle occur. And this may not have been the case for you at all. But likely once you cheated the first time you did start a cycle of your own and it’s important to look at it deeper and deeper. Something is there and it will help you heal.', 'Someone out there is brave enough to downvote but not to leave a comment and have a discussion?', '""Your actions are not you"". I opened up my legs, I took of my clothes, I let teh man fuck me. I hid the affair from my husband for 3 years. But that is not me. Are you fucking kidding me? I think that is the thing some people downvoted.\n\nCheating is very very very simple. Selfish choice made to satisfy their own needs before EVERYTHING else. \n\nI think you should stay away from Esther Perel. From what I\'ve read so far, I believe the cheaters will heal just fine from reading her book because it does not give 2 shits about the betrayed. ""Ey as long as cheaters are healed meant that the book is working innit."" That is literally the purpose of the book. It does NOT give 2 shits about healing the BS.', 'First - I do appreciate you voicing your opinions and helping me see where someone would disagree with me.\n\n\nYes I do believe (as well as every mental health professional I’ve spoken to since my affair) that we are not defined by one action in our life. We can heal, we can change. If she is a whore and its over, story written, then there is no hope and she may as well leave. But many people do survive this and become better. So it’s unhelpful to simply say because of those actions that is who she **is** rather than that’s what she has **done**.\n\nNext I disagree that cheating is simple and I think if you look at it that way healing will be really superficial. It’s complex in terms of how a wayward got to that point. What things in their life contributed to those poor boundaries and the feelings of worthlessness that we sought out someone else instead of trusting in our partner and sharing ourselves openly. It’s complex also in how a betrayed feels afterward and how we can rebuild safety and trust. I personally don’t find any of that simple.\n\nHave you read Esther Perel’s book? In state of affairs she frequently repeats that examining what happened in the affair is not condoning infidelity. She does not condone it at all, but she advocates for learning from the mistakes. She has looked deeply at the situations and shared insights both sides of a couple can learn from in terms of what happened. It is difficult as a wayward to understand after the fog “how the f did I get here?” and in my opinion her book is a good resource in beginning to understand yourself. You will notice I still encouraged OP to dig deeper than “excitement” and that’s exactly something I learned from that book. I did not walk away with any feeling of justification.\n\nThank you again for sharing where you disagree with me, it’s helpful that we reason instead of just fling votes at each other.']","Listen.

The Winnower has chosen to be evil and wage war against the Gardener (aka Traveler) to find out who has the true philosophy of the universe. The Gardener does not want war and simply wants to give life.\n\nThe existence of the universe relies on Light and Dark.\n\nLight does not only mean Gardener, and Dark does not mean only Winnower. They are their own forces which is why Risen can use Light for evil (Warlords) and our Guardian (and Elsie) has used the Darkness for good (defeating Eramis). Its the same reasoning that everything that is Light is not inherently good and everything that is Dark is not inherently evil. Their gods, however, are a different story.\n\nTake another look through Unveiling. The Winnower felt betrayal by the Gardener which is why she seeks war. The Gardener became a rule in the game to add complexity so that every result was not the same, and did not always result in death. Basically, now the Winnower is trying to play the game on a much bigger scale but the stakes are much higher which the Gardener knows this and is trying to do her best to fight, but the Winnower doesn't care. The Winnower seeks nothing but to end all that exists."", '>The Winnower felt betrayal by the Gardener which is why she seeks war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\'t understand why people in this sub in their arguments for the Traveler always downplay how the Garderner literally broke the universal laws because ""she was bored"".

The name of the lore entry is ""The First Knife""\n\nThe entry ends with:\n\n>I looked at the gardener.  \n>  \n>I looked at my hands.  \n>  \n>I discovered the first knife.\n\nA knife is symbolic of betrayal, specifically in this context. This was the whole motivation for the Winnower becoming hell bent on revenge and establishing superiority. The conflict was necessary and ultimately inevitable. Without this conflict, the universe would not exist and neither would this war of the Winnower vs Gardner.\n\nOne thing to note about Unveiling: this is taken from the perspective of the Winnower. It would be interesting if we could see this from the perspective of the Gardener.\n\nI don\'t understand how the actions of the Gardener are seen as a ""non issue"" when this is what started the whole thing.']","Yeah, so once again completely ignore the origin of the conflict which was the Gardener changing the inherent laws that were in operation at the time.

We don’t have to deny that fact in order to recognize that it was a terrible idea in practice that resulted in an astounding level of suffering.\n\nI don’t know why we need to frame residential schools as a liberal vs conservative issue at all, to be honest.

Maybe in the upcoming special, in just a few days, or maybe in the next series.\n\nDon\'t know when and don\'t know how, but I\'m pretty sure it will.\n\nMy personal view would be that Ruth is from an alternate timeline. The alteration of that timeline must be due to someone from \'our\' Doctors timeline (so, the Master probably, or the Doctor themselves) doing something that altered it, because if it wasn\'t, then \'our\' timeline would\'ve never existed in the first place.I think the producers kinda hint at something like this with Orphan-55, when in the end the Doctor gives the fam a speech about how it\'s just one possible future. (It sort of happens again with the other filler episode, Praxeus, but just on a different level, more towards the modern world and the viewers than towards the fam, but the lesson is ""be responsible and change the future"" basically.)\n\nI don\'t even get where the assumption that Ruth must be from before the Doctor ran away from Gallifrey is, at all. It\'s not even hinted at.It\'s established that before the Doctor ran away, before they were, well, **them,** they worked for ""the Division"".The story of Brendan was never linked to Ruth, except for them both being things that still remain mysteries.It is unknown where Ruth falls in the chronology.\n\nSo my assertion remains; Ruth is from an alternate timeline. This is further evidenced by the Fact that the Doctor doesn\'t recognize the Gallifreyan coming after Ruth as Gallifreyan. It\'s some sort of very militarized version of the Gallifrey we know.\n\n**tldr it is unknown where Ruth falls within the chronology, my guess is that she\'s from an alternate timeline (a militarized Gallifrey due to Gallifrey-Nazis in the past winning Gallfreyan WWII or something)**\n\n*these assertions raise more questions however, but I\'ve thought of answers to them as well, this comment is just getting a bit long*', '> I don\'t even get where the assumption that Ruth must be from before the Doctor ran away from Gallifrey is, at all. It\'s not even hinted at.It\'s established that before the Doctor ran away, before they were, well, them, they worked for ""the Division"".The story of Brendan was never linked to Ruth, except for them both being things that still remain mysteries.It is unknown where Ruth falls in the chronology.\n\nIt\'s just Occam\'s razor. We know Ruth is an incarnation of the Doctor who worked for something called the Division, whom 13 can\'t remember but whom she definitely believes to be from her past. The Timeless Children introduces several forgotten pre-Hartnell incarnations of the Doctor, at least one of whom used to work for something called the Division. Assuming that Ruth is pre-Hartnell is simply drawing the shortest line from point A to point B.\n\nThe idea that any alternative timelines are involved is a massive assumption that isn\'t supported by anything in Series 12. Same goes for ""Ruth is 6B"" or ""it\'s all Twelve\'s coma dream"" or any of those other theories. Of course there\'s always the possibility that Chibnall ends up pulling a completely unexpected explanation out of his ass, but even I\'m not cynical enough to believe he\'s THAT bad lol', 'Either you\'ve misunderstood Occam\'s Razor or are being unintentionally ironic. \n\nYou\'re forgetting the ***teensy-little*** fact that Hartnell was the one who stole the TARDIS and got it stuck as a police box, and Ruth had a TARDIS, stuck as a police box. \n\nDo you not see the inherent assumptions you make? \nYou just disregard the Fact that in order for your theory to make sense, the Doctor has to get the chameleon circuit stuck two separate times to the exact same disguise. \nSounds like multiplying entities unnecessarily to me.\n\n>supported by anything in Series 12\n\nRemember that we aren\'t only looking at in-canon explanations, but a combination of in-canon and irl explanations. \n\nIt is supported by the massive central piece that is Ruth\'s stuck-as-a-phone-booth TARDIS, implying that she is post-Hartnell. It is supported by the infamously inaccurate mechanics of the universe being explained in Orphan-55. \n\n*edit just to add to this comment the other point, in Fugitive of the Judoon Gat is shocked, calls two Doctors in the same place and time ""an abomination"" and cites [the Blinovitch limitation effect](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Blinovitch_Limitation_Effect) which is an in-canon explanation: The Blinovitch Limitation Effect was a natural function of the universe that described the effects of approaching and/or making physical or causal contact with a future or past version of yourself, an action that was also referenced as ""crossing your own timeline.""*\n\n\nI said, it\'s my belief. I haven\'t said that it\'s something I think will be fact. \n\nI\'m just saying that\'s what I personally believe in and I have my reasons. \n\nWhat are people\'s reasons for believing the TARDIS is **supposed** to be a phonebooth for a **pre-Hartnell** Doctor? Or are you going with the other people and claiming that a literal centerpiece on screen was ""a mistake"" that meant to imply the exact **opposite** of what it implies; that **Ruth IS post-Hartnell**, because in-canon **Hartnell was the one who got the TARDIS stuck as a phonebooth.**', '> Do you not see the inherent assumptions you make? You just disregard the Fact that in order for your theory to make sense, the Doctor has to get the chameleon circuit stuck two separate times to the exact same disguise. Sounds like multiplying entities unnecessarily to me.\n\nYes, it\'s an assumption. A fairly reasonable assumption that follows naturally from the idea that a memory wipe couldn\'t keep the Doctor\'s Doctor-y tendencies down.\n\n> Where exactly is it stated that Ruth specifically works for the Division, right now? I hope you\'re not confusing her being a fugitive to her working for the Division any more than \'our\' Doctor did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> DOCTOR: Who is this Gat?\n\n> RUTH: I worked for her once.\n\n> DOCTOR: You\'ve got a job?\n\n> RUTH: Oh, sort of. Not one you apply for, and not one you can ever leave. Believe me, I tried. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> And the fact that the Doctor doesn\'t recognize the Gallifreyan Gat.\n\nOf course she wouldn\'t, because her memories of Gat were erased thousands of years ago...\n\n> ""No supporting evidence in s12 for alternate timelines""?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> GAT: There won\'t be two payments, because two of the same Time Lord can\'t occupy the same space at the same time. It\'s an abomination. It\'ll destroy the time streams before you get anywhere near Gallifrey. \n\nLiterally nothing about this line suggests Ruth is from another timeline. On the contrary it only implies Ruth is either from 13\'s past or future, because that\'s generally the context where the Blinovich effect comes up']","&gt;A fairly reasonable assumption

You **really** don't understand Occam's Razor. It's not ""the laziest explanation wins"" it's the problem-solving principle that ""entities should not be multiplied without necessity"". You are quite literally multiplying the TARDIS and it's chameleon circuit's states, without any evidence to back up those assumptions, in-canon or otherwise. 

&gt;tendencies

Having your chameleon circuit stuck in a specific shape isn't a ""tendency"".
Your assumption is that it happened twice and that for Ruth's TARDIS, it happened first. So you're assuming that in-canon established facts, like Hartnell being the one for whom the circuit got stuck, are just ignored? It is clearly stated that the chameleon circuit malfunctions **after** Ian and Barbara join the team. 

Besides, we see a clear difference between the ""mentality"" of 13 and Ruth, where Ruth is heavily implied to be, basically, pro-gun, but she's not **as much as we thought** but still is, to some extent. So while her relative dislike of weapons might be the same (a tendency) the framework in which that relative dislike operates might be far more militaristic (as we see from the gun in itself and the outfit of Gat) leaving her **seeming** like she's different, but actually, relatively, it's the same person, with the same tendencies, but brought up in a different world. (An alternate timeline.)

So your assumption is that it got stuck in the very first episode because of Ruth having got her stuck as one before? 
But it doesn't make sense for Ruth, she's roughly 40 and in 2020. Sure, Time Lord aging doesn't exactly match up to humans, but her bio-cloaking would surely age her at an appropriate speed, which leaves us wondering why would her TARDIS ""chameleon"" as a phonebooth from the sixties? 


So, again, the heavy implication (unless you choose to ignore all canon) is that Ruth is post-Hartnell. 

""her memories of Gat were erased thousands of years ago"". 

No, not her personally. Doesn't recognize that she is Gallifreyan, from her outfit, which is kinda clearly a uniform. 

&gt;Literally nothing about this line suggests Ruth is from another timeline. On the contrary it only implies Ruth is either from 13's past or future, because that's generally the context where the Blinovich effect comes up

Except for the fact that it refers to timelines, which is literally the thing you're arguing against. We aren't only looking for in-canon explicit explanations, references like that are sometimes hints to viewers. 

Yes, nothing in the show means anything except that it was a huge stinking mistake and the showrunner doesn't know anything about the show they're running. 

That's the logic you're going with?

#So, what is your **REASON** that Ruth has a big blue box and not a grey capsule? ""Showrunner's mistake""? 

Makes for a whole hell of a lot of assumptions which aren't even based on anything except echochambers.

&gt;generally the context

Yes. Generally. 

IF I'm right, would you be surprised by the evidence that already there? Nope, you wouldn't, because none of it is mutually exclusive with my theories. 

How about Ruth being pre-Hartnell and there just being two instances of the Doctor becoming  the Doctor and the TARDIS becoming a phonebooth due to a malfunction in a chameleon circuit? 
No evidence at all. Actually, evidence to the contrary.

f030f3p,NeutralPolitics,"['What are the costs and benefits of nuclear power (as opposed to other green sources of energy such as wind and solar) as it stands now?', ""Nuclear is going to have to be a part of any 0-carbon power plan. Wind and Solar are great for steady-state energy, but they can't react to spikes in demand. ~~The only solution is either a lot of expensive batteries that produce a crapload of toxic metal waste, or some other generator that can be adjusted as needed.~~ Natural gas can do that, but then you have the CO2 emissions. Nuclear can also do that, without the Co2, and much more efficiently.\n\n[Integral Fast Reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor#Nuclear_waste) are extremely efficient (like, 99.99% of available energy extracted and used), and safe. IFRs are able to recycle waste from the fuel into more fuel. The only byproducts end up being the highly-volatile isotopes that have half-lives of mere minutes or hours. Those can be stored on-site in containment pools for a short time before they become safe to move to long term storage.\n\nThe problem is that people don't understand that nuclear tech has actually advanced since Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl (both of which were mainly caused by humans doing stupid shit, not the tech itself being faulty). Newer designs have passive safeties that will make then shut down on their own if anything goes wrong. In comparison, reactors like the Fukushima-Daichi plant require active safeties, where power is required for the safety systems to work, the problem is that if there isn't any power then the safeties don't work and you get, well, that.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not saying that nuclear is the ONLY way to go. Rather, I am arguing that nuclear is a safe, efficient, and carbon-free power system and should be included in any green energy plan.\n\nEDIT: Just to address a few of the common points of opposition\n \n- Cost\n\nGE's PRISM^[1](https://nuclear.gepower.com/content/dam/gepower-nuclear/global/en_US/documents/PRISM%20Technical%20Paper.pdf) design is very cost competitive with traditional LWR designs, owing to the modular design that allows it to be scaled progressively over time. The modules can be fabricated in factories, further cutting the cost of construction. Overall the S-PRISM cost 2.9 cents per kWhr^[2](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/33/020/33020128.pdf), making it very competetive with gas, which costs 3.1 cents per kWhr. In fact, the only cheaper source of energy in the American grid is Hydroelectric, which has plenty of drawbacks of it's own.^[3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=19&t=3)\n\n- Still experimental/not proven\n\nAn experimental IRF reactor design was developed and operated at the Argonne Nat'l Lab between 1984 and 1994.^[4](https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/integral-fast-reactor.shtml)\n\n- There are other ways\n\nHydrogen is an incredibly inefficient energy storage medium and more research has to be done to make it commercial viable.^[5](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hydrogen-in-a-low-carbon-economy.pdf) Whereas Gen-IV reactor technology is already established and ready for deployment. Oh, and you need electricity to generate the hydrogen through electrolysis anyway, so you might as well have batteries in that case. Geothermal and hydroelectric are highly regional. Many other proposed alternatives are similarly expensive or still in development, while we have this nuclear technology now.\n\nThat isn't to say that other methods can't be used at all, but that nuclear is an option that can and should be on the table.\n\n- Safety\n\nGen-IV reactors use passive safety systems^[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety) and the NRC does not fuck around with nuclear safety.^[7](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/security-enhancements.html)\n\nPassive safety systems mean that no input is required to trigger them. They are baked into the design of the reactors and cannot be disabled or circumvented.\n\n- Radiation!\n\nRadiation exposure from living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant is a tiny fraction of the natural background radiation dose you receive each year.^[8](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/related-info/faq.html)\n\n- Waste\n\nIFR reactors are highly efficient, almost all of the fuel is consumed and used for power. The small amount of remaining waste has and extremely low half-life, minutes or hours, which means it only needs to be stored on site in cooling ponds for a short time before it is safe to transport to long-term storage.^[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor#Nuclear_waste)\n\n- The Simpsons!\n\nIs a cartoon.\n\nEDIT2: cleared up some murky language and removed an unsourced statement on batteries."", '> The only solution is either a lot of expensive batteries that produce a crapload of toxic metal waste, or some other generator that can be adjusted as needed.\n\nThere are a lot of other good options for short-term energy storage to complement renewable generation: https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/10/Comparison-Of-Dispatchable-Renewable-Electricity-Options-ITP-et-al-for-ARENA-2018.pdf', 'This is missing much of the new technology coming out.

Basically the energy can be stored forever, their problem is converting, they are a little too inefficient at the moment. \n\nWe also just found out we can make Calcium batteries, not sure how dense the energy will be, but the resource is vastly cheaper. \n\nThere is also molten salt batteries.

gt5lv95,changemyview,"[""CMV: Pro-Choice and allowing women to abort their babies is a win-win situation all around, and I really don't see why it's so hotly debated over."", ""For the record, I am pro choice.\n\nThat being said, I think most of your arguments sort of dismiss the entire moral component of the question.  You're looking at it from a purely pragmatic standpoint, and that's fine, but I would encourage you to try to understand that the pro-life people are *not* looking at it from a purely pragmatic standpoint.  They have moral qualms, and your arguments don't really address them.\n\nTo put this in perspective, I'd like to propose a new view: it is okay for parents to murder one-year-old babies.  \n\n\\-Keeps the one-year-olds from being abandoned and ending up in orphanages.\n\n\\-If the mother does not like being a parent, it gives her a second chance at life.\n\n\\-One-year-old kids haven't had a chance to sin, so they go to heaven.\n\n\\-One-year-olds cry a lot, so murdering them eliminates annoying crying.\n\n\\-Definitely helps with global overpopulation.\n\n\\-Gives parents an out in case of accidental pregnancy - maybe they decide to try raising the kid but it doesn't work out, and if they murder it, it won't have to go to an orphanage.  \n\n\\-Prevents the kid from growing up with potentially abusive parents who don't want to care for it.  \n\nNow, I'm guessing (correct me if I'm wrong) that you have some moral qualms about allowing parents to murder one-year-olds.  It seems to me that your arguments largely apply equally to both one-year-olds and fetuses, so if they are not morally persuasive for one, they should not be morally persuasive for the other.  Again, to be clear, I am not saying the arguments do not make pragmatic sense, I'm saying they do not establish a moral difference between infants and fetuses.\n\nNow, you do draw one distinction between fetuses and infants, which is the ability to experience pain.  However,  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the best available science shows that fetuses *can* experience pain in the third trimester.  So if ability to experience pain is your distinguishing factor, I think logically you should *at least* be opposed to late term abortions.  Unless you question the available science, in which case it is entirely possible that fetuses can experience pain even earlier.  \n\nSo: can you give me an argument which morally supports third trimester abortions, but which cannot also apply to one-year-olds?\n\nFood for thought."", 'The difference is easy to point out tbh. A 1 year old isn’t inside someone’s body. A 1 year old does not need to tear anyone’s genitals to live. A 1 year old does not increase anyone’s risk of death when they care for them. Caring for a 1 year old is not a medical condition. Being pregnant can kill you (even a healthy pregnancy). Pregnancy will affect a woman’s health (often long term). Pregnancy and childbirth will lead to at least some physical trauma/damage even in the best of circumstances.', ""These differences do not speak to the moral question that is at the center of the pro life perspective.  That's sort of what I'm trying to get at.  In the pro life perspective, there is not a fundamental difference between the value of the life of a fetus and the value of the life of an infant, so aborting a fetus is murder in the same way that killing a child would be.  \n\nAgain, I'm not trying to dismiss the value of your points.  I would say you make a very compelling case on a practical level.  But if I was religious, which I am not, your practical arguments would not be at all persuasive in the face of my belief in a higher moral truth."", 'IMO, whenever people only list practical benefits to kill pre-born children, because rarely are they able to gain any moral high ground, it just sounds like victim blaming.\n\nIn the standard case, the child is created by directly by one’s own actions. That’s a fact. \n\nSo saying, well life would be easier if I could just kill it is victim blaming. \n\nImagine if I bought a dog. The dog is now in my care as a result of my own action. But now life is harder for me. Would anyone actually say I would be able to kill it? Surely not. \n\nAnd I also don’t buy the “too many children in orphanages” argument either. All of those children still want to live. They all still have a right to live. They the a fundamental God/constitutional right to life. Just because you kill them before they are able to express that, doesn’t make it okay. And if you ask abortion survivors, they’re pro-life too. \n\nTo me, most of OP’s arguments just boil down to “their life is worthless to me and they’re not able to fight me on it so I win by default”.']","My biggest issue is that you're speaking for people. ""If you ask abortion survivors, they're pro-life too"", is just wrong. Did you ask every abortion survivor? Do you know this to be fact? Then you cant use this for your argument and its gross to try to get away with it. It shows me that you dont care about listening to others views if youre going to make up and use ""emotional evidence"" that doesnt actually exist.

 \-----Hebrews 11:5 KJV 

&gt;By faith Enoch was translated that he should not **see** death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God 

\-----Hebrews 11:5 New International Version

&gt; By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not **experience** death: ""He could not be found, because God had taken him away."" For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. 

\-----Hebrews 11:13 

&gt;**These all died in faith**, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 

\-----Hebrews 11:39 39 

&gt;And **these all**, having obtained a good report through faith, **received not the promise:** 

It says Enoch did not ""see"" or ""experience"" death. But it does say he died, God simply took him. If you die a natural death then you *experienced* death. Most people experience death unless you are lucky and die in your sleep and are completely unaware, but we aren't sure if people have a dream or experience something in their mind as they die in their sleep or not. Who knows...

But the scripture does say these ""all"" died. Enoch died, he just didn't have to experience the sting of death.

&amp;#x200B;

When does he get to receive the promise?

 \-----1Corinthians 15:50 

&gt;Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; **We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,** In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, **at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.** For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 

\-----Job 14:14 

&gt;If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time **will I wait, till my change come.**

So it is partially in inversion of Christianity (true redemption for real sins).', ""If you're getting your analysis from Lindsay, I can see why you'd think this. But these would be some of the fundamental mistakes right here. I see CRT getting cast a lot as a hopeless system, one which says there's no end to the problems it looks at.

Here's the second of two core principles of CRT:\n\n>Second, that transforming the relationship between law and racial power, as well as achieving racial\xa0emancipation\xa0and\xa0anti-subordination\xa0more broadly, are possible"", 'That sounds very much like the warmed over oppressor-oppressed narrative... packed full of unwarranted assumptions, immunity from evidence, reduction to racial categories, etc...', ""You can find lots more oppressor-oppressed language in one of my favorite books, the Bible. \n\nBut seriously, virtually none of those categories apply to CRT.

That has nothing to do with this Marxian worldview that casts everything in terms of that narrative and which is, by design, exempt from having to prove actual instances of oppression... it’s baked it and that is not at all like the Bible.

Special emphasis here on simplistic... not in volume of concepts and refining words, but simple in that once you know the rules all answers determined. Ideological possession indeed. \n\nAnd just saying Lindsey is wrong does not make it so.', '>That has nothing to do with this Marxian worldview\n\nCRT is neither ""Marxian"" nor a worldview.  It is a theory, and takes a very different tact than Marx did - but guys like Lindsay tend to boil down just about everything left of center-right at ""Marxist,"" so I understand the confusion. \n\n>that casts everything in terms of that narrative\n\nCRT doesn\'t try to describe ""everything."" It\'s analysis is primarily on the American legal/political system.\n\n>and which is, by design, exempt from having to prove actual instances of oppression\n\nThis is also not true. It\'s hard to react to this, because you can\'t really disprove an unfounded accusation, but suffice it to say that there\'s nothing in any CRT writing that would lend me to give this idea creedence. If there\'s a specific writer or writing you\'re familiar with that teaches this, I\'d be happy to check it out. \n\n>Moreover, the “solutions” provided by CRT have more to do with Nazism than biblical Christianity.. in that CRT simply designates a scapegoat race\n\nTo compare critiquing white supremacy with Hitler\'s attempted murder of every single Jew in the territory he controlled or conquered is beyond the pale. It\'s not true that CRT\'s ""solutions"" are targeted at an entire race, or that they\'re violent in nature. This is a preposterous assertion, and it tells me you\'re either not arguing in good faith, or all of your information about CRT comes from people who are lying to you about it. \n\nSaying Lindsay is an expert does not make it so either, and you\'ve presented nothing to defend his credentials. But you have repeated his arguments, I\'ve pointed out which ones are explicitly untrue, so that tells us something about the source. If you dig into my comment history, you can likely find a line by line analysis I provided of a recent article by Lindsay on CRT, where he makes several fundamental mistakes, such as: \n\n* CRT ""doesn\'t trust"" any attempts to improve racism. As we saw in the second core tenet of CRT, this is fundamentally untrue. It teaches the exact opposite - that racism is a defeatbale evil, and it can be done using the same systems that have propagated it in the past. \n* CRT is ""against free societies and wants to dismantle them."" The assertion is again made without evidence, but as mentioned above, CRT doesn\'t seek to dismantle society. As a legal theory, it works primarily within the existing legal frameworks we have, which is hard to do if you destroy them. \n\nIn general, he does a lot of personifying CRT, saying it ""rejects"" things, or ""acts"" in a certain way, or ""cannot be disagreed with."" This is odd, because CRT is not a person. It does not act in any way. It is a set of writings, or potentially a way of thinking about certain issues. He often does this without actually citing any authors, speakers, thinkers, etc. In other words, he makes a claim about CRT without providing any evidence. This doesn\'t make him wrong, but it does make him unserious and not to be taken seriously. \n\nAnd on that tact, I\'m off to enjoy Christmas Eve. I don\'t have the time, energy, or wherewithal to argue with someone who thinks anti-racists are the real Nazis, and I don\'t think I\'m going to change your mind. I think you\'ve gotten all your information about the topic from people who are intentionally demonizing it, and that\'s not a mindset that can be effectively reasoned with. I hope you see how that kind of analysis can turn tautological or cyclical. And if you can\'t - Merry Christmas anyways.

You have a self-admitted tendency to control the trajectory of your relationship. Every time your boyfriend has decided to move on, you convince him to come back and give your relationship another go. Did you notice that that cycle of breaking up/getting back together has been largely led by *you* and *your* desires? \n\nAnother question I'd like you to sit and ponder. You wrote:\n\n>This past year we had a very long dry spell because of me. I don’t know what was going on but I just didn’t have a sex drive and this lead us to have horrible arguments.   \n>  \n>and:  \n>  \n>I cheated on him with a guy who asked for my number on social media. We began talking and he was very funny, sweet, and attractive. Eventually temptation got the best of me and I cheated on my boyfriend last week. \n\nI want you to try and see this from a logical perspective: do you get how your lack of sexual desire for him becomes a moot point when all it took was some sweet words from a stranger on social media to make you decide to cheat? Your boyfriend not only took you back after he made the choice to move on, but he continued treating you with affection and respect - he should have been the one you were feeling these feelings for. This leads me to believe that your issues aren't really with sex, but instead are issues with a constant need for validation and constant stimulus (meaning, you aren't okay with things being normal or at a healthy status quo) and an innate sense of selfishness and lack of gratitude. I don't say these to put you down, but I think it's really important that we accept and face our flaws so that we can face them head on. \n\nand I think this line bears repeating:\n\n>The reason we broke up was because I was controlling of his social life and our sex life wasn’t the best.\n\nin addition to:\n\n>I know if I come clean to my BF that he would absolutely leave me. I don’t think he would want to forgive after all the other trial and tribulations our relationship has had.\n\nYour boyfriend took the proper steps towards making the healthy choices for himself. Instead of cheating, he decided to end the relationship so that he could find what he wanted. However, your desire to not lose him is what kept him coming back. That same desire to get what *you* want out of this is what is motivating you to keep this a secret. \n\nDon't you think you've controlled his life enough? Don't you think you owe him the freedom to make a choice about whether or not he wants to be with you?\n\nI truly encourage you to take the first step towards redemption and relinquish the control you are desperate to hold onto. It sounds like your relationship has been largely on your terms. I encourage you to do the selfless thing and to tell him the truth. The possibility of him leaving might torture you, but you telling him the truth is one of the greatest acts of love one person can give to another. \n\nThe outcome might not be what you want it to be, but that is a natural consequence of our actions. Losing him will not be the end of your life - you still have the RIGHT to get into therapy and become a healthier and more empathetic and compassionate person. You deserve the chance to improve as an individual, with or without your boyfriend in your life. \n\nPlease keep posting, you took the first step by reaching out - all you have to do is keep moving forward in honesty and compassion :) ""]",Wow.

Both women come from very humble backgrounds and both achieve positions of unparalleled respect and privilege - Wynne also doesn't return to live in Kinloch Hold after the Blight but can stay as an advisor at Fereldan court or travel with Shale. Both consider Circles to be necessary and recognize the benefits that mages are afforded (safety, education, not having to worry about physiological needs like food, rest, warmth, etc) and neither actually advocate for turning them into prisons but simply wish the mages to approach their powers responsibly and agree to having templar oversight. Wynne also comes to preach patience and cooperation with the Templar Order (while she herself isn't subject to the same conditions) at the White Spire in *Asunder* and voices pretty much the same opinions that we hear from Vivienne.\n\nI don't really understand why Viv is so unpopular :("", 'Her attitude.

As for Anders’, I think the whole terrorism plotline is handled in a nuanced and complex way (ultimately, there was never going to be a peaceful solution to the Mage/Templar solution and Anders DOES successfully force a change which longterm improves lives for Mages. But that said, I’m really NOT an ends-justify-the-means person), and, as shitty a person as he is, there’s a lot of really sympathetic qualities to Anders (most notably the fact that he runs a free clinic healing refugees and helps Mages escape Kirkwall’s oppressive circle, actions which put his life directly in danger for the sole purpose of helping others with absolutely nothing to gain, and something we never see Vivienne do). \n\nI think this is waaaay too harsh on Fenris, though, and I will absolutely, 100% die on the hill that he’s a way better person than Vivienne is.\n\n“Not being nice” is also a pretty... generous way to describe Vivienne, given she’s straight up classist/elitist, prone to an endless amount of casual cruelty, ignore’s the chantry’s history of racism towards Elves/Dwarves/etc. (even as divine), and supports extremely oppressive policies. (Then yeah. She’s actively assholish too if she dislikes you). \n\nAlso, stan Morrowind. 💜']","&gt; the whole terrorism plotline is handled in a nuanced and complex way

I'm just gonna let this one stand on its own regarding Anders.

Fenris is NUTS. He's had a hard life, I don't deny, and some of his overreactions are understandable, but at the very least he's a severely traumatized person who should more probably be in some kind of psychiatric institution than a tumbled down ruin of his torturer's, drinking wine and brooding all day- which is what he chooses to do, once he has his freedom. A mage torturing you does not mean all mages deserve to be killed, and that's his default position from your first meeting. Imagine if somebody kidnaps you, locks you in iron chains, and tortures you with iron tools, ""kill all blacksmiths"" isn't a sane response. Despite seeing firsthand responsible use of magic by Hawke/Bethany/Merrill, he still disapproves of helping any mages ever, sometimes even just listening when mages talk, even when those mages are being tortured themselves.

Thedas isn't a modern society. Thedas, particularly Ferelden/Orlais/The Free Marches are late-Medieval-ish, and radically different social orders than modern Western democracies. Literally every character in the world has some decree of classism/elitism by our standards, and maybe none moreso than Varric, who constantly makes offhand remarks about nobles-this, commoners-that, elves-are-this, dwarves-are-that, but try getting anybody in the fandom to talk about Varric, Zevran, Sebastian, or Leliana not having modern ideas of class and race as quickly as you can get people onboard roasting Vivienne.

Casual cruelty- Really? I mean, she insults party members, but everybody loves Varric, and Isabela, and Morrigan, and Dorian, and they all insult other party members too. She doesn't approve of casual cruelty, and approves of the Inquisitor helping people and making the world better. I'm not sure where this is coming from.

As far as the Chantry goes, sure, there's definitely some past and present wrongs there, but she never denies that, does she? And what can she really do about it in her position during the game? Per the epilogues she quells uprisings and rebellions, but that's kind of part and parcel with being Divine, right? Nobody would fault a Divine Leliana or Cassandra for crushing rebellions of rebel rogues or knights, and without more context and information it seems like this very much reflects what lens you already see Vivienne through. We also don't have any information on how she deals with dwarves or elves as Divine.

For oppressive policies, that's just down on whether you think the circles are a good things or not, isn't it? Personally I think you have to end up with a system basically like the Southern circles or have a system that's a lot like Tevinter- If mages are free to use their magic without oversight, they'll use it to get ahead in life, and over time the system will drift further and further towards Tevinter, while if mages have oversight, the logistical concerns will lead to mages and armed protectors/overseers living closer and closer to one another. That being said, Vivienne's circles are some of the best treatment mages in the South have ever gotten from the Chantry and templars.

Literally everyone is an asshole to you if they dislike you- Alistair, Morrigan, Oghren are assholes; Sten/Liliana/Zevran will try to kill you if they dislike you enough, Anders; Fenris, and Isabella are all jackasses to you under the Rivalry mode; Cassandra becomes a drunk jackass; Sera and Solas become incredible jackasses; and Dorian may win the star-spangled crown of Ultimate Jackass at low approval, I'm not sure that really has any bearing.

We’ve made it this far technologically and as a society we’re moving bounds and leaps, why is change NECESSARY, why is progression NECESSARY?\n\n(Again, just sparking debate.)', '(This is super off topic but as someone who has contributed before in this sub, I can’t really be bothered by anything right now while the government continues to send billions to massive businesses, the military-industrial complex and Israel while the entire population of the USA only gets a fraction of the $900 billion bill. We need to fucking learn from the other first world countries.)\n\nNow with that out the way, I begin my short essay. I will say, yes, in some sense the old Patriarchal system has worked, however, it’s worked in the same way slavery worked. \n\nTo clarify, what I mean is, society “worked” while we were actively practicing slavery. Society “worked” while we were actively practicing child labor.\n\nNow, female gender roles are not as bad as child labor or slavery, before someone is quick to erect a strawman. But, women’s rights were not good back in the day (they sucked), we can all agree on that.\n\nSo I think most guys here will agree we need women’s rights, same way we need rights for blacks. Now, you can’t say you’ve given women all the rights they deserve without actually allowing them to get educated and be welcome everywhere men are, so we pretty much did that as well in many parts of the western world. You can even make an argument that parts of society where women are still unwelcome are evenly matched by parts of society men are excluded from, making things equal in this regard (I’m not claiming this).\n\nNow comes the topic of female leadership, this is quite debatable as we as a society are *not sure* if men happen to be in positions of power more often due to them playing fair or due to male privilege. \n\nOne thing’s for sure though, that the men who *are* at the top, they often are there due to *some* sort of privilege. For example, you aren’t born a Rothschild, so you are automatically not as important. \n\nIn reality, in my opinion, and this is my core belief, we need feminism because we value all humans equally, however, while female leadership is definitely good in the sense that it’s representation of half the population, it’s a complex issue to tackle. Once society settles down (I should say if, and that’s a big if) about male and female identities, people will start to see that naturally, there are disparities in the percent of males and females in different areas of society, and people will be okay with it because sexism isn’t a systematic issue.\n\nIn the end, sexism will always be an issue on the individual scale and you might always have radical feminists arguing that everything must be under the control of women (and men who are equally mad), they might even suggest that women modify their bodies to become more masculine than men if testosterone gives a statistical edge to males.\n\nWe’re already seeing that women are capable of a lot, given women are quickly surpassing men in many areas of STEM. In my opinion, we don’t need everything to be equal.', 'I disagree with a lot of what you wrote. The issue here is treating men like they are all the ones at the top.

errc8li,NeutralPolitics,"['What are the pros and cons of taxing capital gains as ordinary income?', 'As a tax attorney, I could write a treatise on this.\n\n[The richest 10% of American\'s own 84% of the stocks, the next 10% own 9.3% and the bottom 80% own 6.7%](https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/sep/18/ro-khanna/what-percentage-americans-own-stocks/). Right from that, we know that basically all stocks are owned by the top 80% of income earners.\n\nI cannot find specific data on what percentage of stocks are owned by retirement accounts, but it\'s a realistic assumption to say that the majority of stocks are owned by retirement accounts. Which means that sometime in the future, barring another 2008, some people will benefit at retirement.\n\nBut, why change capital gains rates, won\'t that hurt retirees if in fact retirement accounts hold most of the stocks? \n\nNo. Retirees *do not* pay capital gains taxes on retirement accounts. They either pay ordinary income taxes (IRAs, 401(k), pension, 403(b), etc.) or no tax (Roth IRA). If a retiree is paying capital gains, it\'s because they hold money in a non-qualified account, which means they maxed out the contributions to their retirement accounts (currently, $19,000 per year in a 401(k)). If they were able to max out their retirement accounts, they\'re able to pay ordinary income tax. After all, they somehow survived their entire lifetimes paying ordinary income taxes and not capital gains, why should that be different in retirement? Either you\'re making the same amount of money, in which case you can pay ordinary income taxes, or you\'re making less and your tax bracket has gone down, and you can pay ordinary income taxes.\n\nAs to why capital gains are taxed differently, the lie that is consistently told is that it encourages investment. According to the right-leaning Tax Policy Center, [lower capital gains rates do not spur economic growth, but lower rates encourage tax avoidance strategies](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-effect-lower-tax-rate-capital-gains).  You see, it\'s a completely bullshit argument that lower tax rates encourage investment by offsetting the risk of investing. Do you know what offsets the risk of investing? The potential for unlimited returns.\n\nAs a tax attorney who also practices corporate law, many of my clients are entrepreneurs, many of whom I\'ve worked with since I formed their companies. Do you know how many times a founder has come to be and said, ""I want to start a business because, when I sell it for $100 million, I don\'t want to pay ordinary income taxes, I want to pay capital gains""? Exactly none. In fact, *I* always bring up the various tax aspects that we can play around with to reduce their taxable income, and their response is usually, ""yeah, that\'s great... but have you seen my technology, isn\'t it cool?""\n\nGoing back to the Tax Policy Center article for a second regarding avoidance strategies, a large part of my job as a tax attorney is to take wealthy (and by wealthy people, I mean insane wealth, $50 million and up) and convert it from ordinary income to capital gains through legal means. My hourly rate is quite high, but when we\'re talking about saving millions, it\'s a pretty good deal. My rate is *far* higher than the average person could even hope to afford. Not that the average person would benefit from most of this stuff, because the tax code is geared towards wealthy business owners, not the bottom 99.9% who are W2 workers.\n\n[Here\'s an article that perfectly encapsulates everything I\'m talking about](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/opinion/aoc-wealth-tax.html). It is also a very pointed criticism of AOC\'s tax of 70% on incomes over $10 million. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Wealth people don\'t pay ordinary income taxes. Wealthy people pay capital gains. And to hammer that point home, [here\'s Bill Gates on the matter, stating exactly that](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18220756/bill-gates-tax-rate-70-percent-marginal-modern-monetary-theory). That also leads into one of my major criticisms of AOC and those who like her. She has no experience and advocates things that sound good but have no basis in reality. In terms of form over substance, it\'s no different than Republicans, and that\'s dangerous. Ignorance is a danger, no matter what side of the political aisle. That\'s why Elizabeth Warren\'s policies are 1,000x better than anything AOC has ever said, because Elizabeth Warren has experience and puts forth brilliant policies. But... I digress, back to capital gains vs. ordinary income.\n\nHere\'s a fun fact, corporations *do not* pay preferential capital gains rates. While corporations do pay capital gains taxes, those taxes are at a corporations ordinary income rate. Somehow, they\'re able to survive.\n\nWhy it changed from rates that were much closer to ordinary income is basically Reagan and trickle down economics. The whole idea that if you give wealthy people more money, they\'ll somehow give it to non-wealthy people in the form of more jobs and businesses and the like. As an attorney who represents wealthy people, they don\'t. There\'s just no data to support that. In fact, the last 40 years prove that does not happen as wealth inequality has skyrocketed since trickle down has been pushed.\n\nNow, there is one legitimate argument to keeping capital gains rates lower than ordinary income and that has to do with inflation. Right now, if I buy a building in 1950 for $100,000 and I sell it in 2020 for $10,000,000 (and let\'s say I\'ve never depreciated it, and I\'ve never made any improvements to it, just to keep things simple), I\'d be taxed, at capital gains rates, on a gain of $9,900,000. But... that doesn\'t account for the fact that inflation has occurred in the intervening 70 years. Had I just put that $100,000 in a fund that tracked inflation, it\'d be worth [$1,081,710.64](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=100000&year1=195001&year2=201903). The fact that basis in an asset doesn\'t adjust for inflation is a rationale for lower capital gains rates as I\'m realistically being taxed on $900,000 that I kind of shouldn\'t be because inflation is a thing that occurs. But... that doesn\'t mean capital gains rates should be half of ordinary income rates. They should maybe be like 5% lower than your ordinary income bracket. That\'d likely account for the difference.\n\nAnd just to show you how the tax code is bought by wealthy people, let\'s look at [Sec. 1221](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221) which defines what are capital assets (weirdly by saying, everything is a capital asset, except 1221(a)(1)-(8), which are actually most things). But, let\'s specifically look at [Sec. 1221(a)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221#a_3), which says that items sold by their creators are not capital assets. What does that mean? It means that if you paint a painting and then sell it, that\'s ordinary income to you. But, if I buy it from you, then sell it, that\'s capital gains to me. That\'s the case for songs, paintings, books, films, sculptures, and whatever else you can create and sell.\n\nBut... if we look at [Sec. 1221(b)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221#b_3), it provides a nice little carve out that says, if you create musical works (songs), you can elect out of 1221(a)(3) ordinary income treatment and get taxed at capital gains rates. \n\nWhy does that exist? Well... let me tell you.\n\nThe country music association was tired of its members paying ordinary income rates when capital gains rates were so much lower. So they ~~bribed~~ lobbied Congress to pass 1221(b)(3) so their members (and all other songwriters) didn\'t have to pay ordinary income rates, because fuck you, they should pay less than people who work for a living and all other artists.\n\nThat\'s just one blatant example of how money buys you the code provisions that benefit you. I could get into *way* more complex examples, but that\'s a fairly easy to understand example.\n\nAs I said, I could write a treatise on this topic, and at nearly 8,000 words, I\'m well on my way.\n\nIf you have questions, ask, as I promise you I know more about this subject than any person who will chime in. I am a corporate and tax attorney with a BS in finance, a JD and a Tax LLM from a top 5 law school. I represent many companies and wealthy people, I\'ve argued tax cases with the IRS and state tax departments. I do extensive tax planning for my clients. This is my life.', ""This is super general and open ended, but pros and cons about the Republican tax plan?  I know I lost out on about 6k in deductions because of the SALT cap.

Why did you take a day to announce this change that everyone quickly noticed was causing problems?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We did not communicate this test to the Community in advance, which created an environment where users and other members of our larger community, including platform moderators, were caught off guard. Because of this, some misinformation has spread across Discord, Reddit, and other parts of the AI Dungeon community. As a result, it became difficult to hold the conversations we want to have about what type of content is permitted on AI Dungeon.\n\nI'm yet to see any attempt at a conversation on the Devs part on reddit until now. Seems like that would've been an easy way to try and quell misinformation instead of leaving us to piece everything together ourselves. Of fucking course misinformation would spread if you stayed silent for a whole day, seriously, have you learnt nothing about the internet in the past 20 years? The only time I saw a Latitude employee on here was to correct someone taking his words out of context. No mention of this situation was made and no attempt was made to answer the questions posed directly to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This test is focused on preventing the use of AI Dungeon to create child sexual abuse material. This means content that is sexual or suggestive involving minors; child sexual abuse imagery; fantasy content (like “loli”) that depicts, encourages, or promotes the sexualization of minors or those who appear to be minors; or child sexual exploitation.  \n>  \n>ARE YOU PREVENTING ALL SEXUAL CONTENT OR SWEARING?  \n>  \n>AI Dungeon will continue to support other NSFW content, including consensual adult content, violence, and profanity.\n\nSeems like it targets more than just sexual activity directed at minors. Swearing, animals, just numbers that are under 18 seem to be no-no words now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For the vast majority of players, it shouldn’t. It will only affect your gameplay if you pursue these kinds of inappropriate gameplay experiences.\n\nWell, you clearly need to fix your system first for this to be true.

fl5aino,CPTSD,"['I get triggered when people choose money over other people, safety and well being']","People still have bills to pay, now and after the pandemic is over. It’s not that people are necessarily choosing money, they’re choosing housing, food, electricity, etc.

I grew up with a lot of instability—part of why I have CPTSD. Constantly told I cost a lot to feed (leading to me just not eating, or hiding to eat), being screamed at for having lights on, etc.—raised by a single mother with BPD/NPD, so you can imagine. So yeah, financial stability is insanely important to me. If I lost my income, I’d be freaking out, so I don’t blame the people who are still working. Not to mention the fact that a lot of places have trimmed it down to just essential businesses—food, pharmacies, health care, groceries, and the like. Those jobs are essential in a time like this, and we would all be screwed if they stopped going to work.

People like myself who can work from home absolutely need to be doing so. Companies who can afford to need to be paying people who can’t work remotely while they have to be out for this (mine is), but not every company is large enough to afford it on their own, so the government needs to step in with some kind of solution to help. But I can’t hate people for trying to provide for themselves and their families, and for continuing to go in for essential jobs that we’re all depending on.

They both imply that Falco has seen something while he was unconscious that was most likely memories from one of the characters on Paradis. The statement in the anime that he was flying around titans with swords is just a more precise and explicit hint in my opinion than the question why Colt wears these clothes. 
Titan shifters can see memories of past titan shifters. But Falco isn't a titan shifter in this scene. So there might logically only be one possibility.
.
.
.
[MANGA SPOILERS] 
.
.
.
The only possibility to see memories of other titan shifter is to be a future holder of the Attack Titan, like Eren in chapter 1 where he didn't have the Attack Titan yet but still was able to see his own memories from the future which he has sent back to his younger self. That could imply that Falco is going to get the Attack Titan eventually since it's the only possibility for him to see memories of presumably Eren at that point.

.
.
It's kinda far-fetched and I guess the explanation for Falco having such a vision is somehow related to information we don't have yet. 
The other possibility is that this is meant as a breach of the 4th wall, since anime only watchers would be kinda confused at that point and ask themselves ""What's happening, where and when is this story playing and who are these characters? Where are the characters I know?"", the characters who were flying around with swords and killing titans with swords the viewer has seen until this point. So Falco could be expressing the audience's confusion of what's going on here and imply to them that all this may seem new to them and they have to watch the story from the view of the Marleyans in order to understand the whole conflict.",Spoiler Tag Your Comments/Flair Your Posts App...,"content,format",True

gqgwsr7,FemdomCommunity,['Help with male orgasm torture/ overstimulation scene'],"My former wife/Mistress was very much into this, so maybe I can give a little perspective from a male's point of view. Several years ago, she had me purchase a Venus 2000 (I think that's what it is called). It has a tube with a sleeve inside that slides up and down to massage a man's cock. We rigged a bondage table with the Venus hanging from a metal bar going over the table. It had a tendency to fall off after I came and started getting flaccid, so after watching a few videos on the subject, we figured out how to stabilize it so that no matter what condition I was in, it never came off. 

It was not a very complicated engineering job for me to do this, but, it became something that I came to *regret* having helped figured out. 

This kink became one of my Mistresses favorite activities. At first, OMG, it was incredible, but, I soon realized that this process was torturous beyond belief after the first two orgasms. 

As a more mature man, I require a fair amount of recovery time. The Venus, when fully operational, didn't give two shit's about my comfort. Neither did she! It just kept going and going. There were times where I would experience up to eight orgasms in one very long session. It was very painful at times, but the damn thing would keep going and would always force another orgasm out of me. After a couple, I was having dry orgasms that were a mix of extreme pain and unbelievable pleasure. 

For me, I had to be completely restrained and I was often hooded and gagged. The slow transition from pain to the point where you just can't stop the orgasm is hard to describe. For women to watch, I know she and her friends really enjoyed the experience, but for men...be careful what you wish for.","We're here to talk about femdom, not masturbat...",off-topic,True

Like it\'s a bit odd to just say it\'s ""the system"" since that can refer to any number of things, so do you mean that it continues to exist because old laws are still on the books, or is it because people actively contribute to it, or what?\n\n>People always ask me to prove that our system of racism is ongoing today. I find it an odd request to prove a negative. \n\nPeople asking you to prove systemic racism exists isn\'t them asking you to proving a negative.  They\'re asking you to prove something still exists.', 'Actually if someone says ""racism ended"" and he says ""racism didn\'t end."" Then ya. That\'s proving the negative.\n\nBut the big issue is that people believe that just because the laws change thanks to the civil rights movement that means there is no racism in the system. This is propagated by right wing influencers. \n\nFor example :https://youtu.be/ywDn8ra4YP8\n\nThis video has the person straight out say ""There is no legal rights a white person possess that a black person does not..there are no laws that reference a person\'s race.""\n\nThis is incredibly naive. It doesn\'t seem to argue in an policy or action between now and the civil rights that could help in achieving equality it only mentions the law.', '>Actually if someone says ""racism ended"" and he says ""racism didn\'t end."" Then ya. That\'s proving the negative.\n\nEh, I guess, it can go either way but at this point, it\'s just semantics irrelevant to the actual discussion.\n\n>But the big issue is that people believe that just because the laws change thanks to the civil rights movement that means there is no racism in the system.\n\nWhat is the system, and how can it be racist? It\'s not like there\'s some hive mind that dictates exactly who gets what job, how much everyone gets paid, and who gets arrested for what crimes, and so on. You seem to indicate that it it\'s more than just laws, but don\'t really elaborate on what it is.', 'Implementation is a big part of it. For example a black person are often judged harder then a white person for the same crime. \n\nOften people say that this is out of people\'s hands, that this is just racist indidvual, but individuals make up the system and if racism can exist in the system with no oversight then some things need to be reconsiderd.\n\nThere is also the matter of implicit racist laws (probably a better term for them), laws that don\'t mention black people but are aimed at things that black people are connected to in the social construct. For example a store with a sign saying ""no saggy pants"" when that was popular in fashion for black people. On paper: it doesn\'t mention race, but it is targeting something we connect to race. \n\nThe best example of this is the war on drugs, which the Nixon administration straight out admitted was created to arrest protestors and black people.\n\n"" You understand what I\'m saying? We knew we couldn\'t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did"" - John Ehrlichman, domestic policy chief for Richard Nixon\n\nAnd that leads back to implementation because many people are aware that the imbalance enforcement of marijuana laws. \n\nIt\'s very simple to just make any random thing illegal and just arrest the people you want to arrest.', '>Often people say that this is out of people\'s hands, that this is just racist indidvual, but individuals make up the system and if racism can exist in the system with no oversight then some things need to be reconsiderd.\n\nAlright, so to clarify, ""the system"" is the effects of the collective actions of individuals?\n\nSo if this is the case, how many individuals need to contribute to it in order for it to be systemic racism, as opposed to just normal racism?\n\n>For example a store with a sign saying ""no saggy pants"" when that was popular in fashion for black people. On paper: it doesn\'t mention race, but it is targeting something we connect to race. \n\nThat seems to be more directed at culture but point taken.\n\nIn any case, how common are those kinds of things in the modern era?\n\n>The best example of this is the war on drugs, which the Nixon administration straight out admitted was corrected to arrest protestors and black people. \n\nSure, but that was about 50 years ago. Sure, it wasn\'t *that* long ago, but still, a lot can change in that time. Like enforcement aside, many states are making marijuana altogether completely legal or decriminalized.\n\n>And that leads back to implementation because many people are aware that the imbalance enforcement of marijuana laws. \n\nRight, one thing I\'ve read about this (feel free to correct me if something is incorrect) is that police don\'t just go around looking for people smoking weed, and only really arrest someone for marijuana if they actually get a complaint. One argument is that because black people are more likely to live in poorer areas where apartments might be closer together and with improper ventilation, that makes reports of marijuana usage more common in those areas, thus leading to the statistics we see.\n\nThe best way to verify this would be arrest rates broken down by race *and* income so that we can see whether race is the determining factor or if it\'s actually income.\n\nThe fact that race is correlated with socioeconomic status (the reason(s) for which is also a discussion) makes socioeconomic status a very noteworthy confound with many statistics.', '>Alright, so to clarify, ""the system"" is the effects of the collective actions of individuals?\n\n>So if this is the case, how many individuals need to contribute to it in order for it to be systemic racism, as opposed to just normal racism?\n\nWould you want there to be any number of racist judges/cops? There might not be a solid number but we have to keep working on it. \n\nI mean it was individuals that kept on getting into car accidents when the automobile was first created but eventually we created systems to control those indidvuals and reduce fatalities and we continue tinkering with that system to improve it.\n\n>In any case, how common are those kinds of things in the modern era?\n\nThe no saggy pants thing was only a couple years ago. That aside there are still people fighting implicit forms of discrimination. For example in work places hair styles associated with black people were often restricted or banned, being seen as unprofessional.\n\nFurthermore ya, while things can change in 50 years doesn\'t mean they do. Only 16 states allow recreational marijuana use, meaning that there are still 34 states that are upholding a law created as an excuse to strip away civil liberties. \n\n>police don\'t just go around looking for people smoking weed,\n\nThing is some of the laws are there to make it easier to go after these people. For example when police conduct a raid on your home they have to only wait 20 seconds after they knock to break down your door I\'m case you flush down evidence. We are arresting people for such a small amount of drugs that you can flush them down the toilet in 20 seconds.\n\n>One argument is that because black people are more likely to live in poorer areas where apartments might be closer together\n\nMaybe that\'s legit, but the fact that black people are more likely to be in proverty is also part of the system.', '>Would you want there to be any number of racist judges/cops? There might not be a solid number but we have to keep working on it.\n\nSure, of course we want to reduce racism wherever possible, but if the question ""does systemic racism still exist?"" only requires one person to be racist, then that\'s not a very useful question. If that were the case, there would be systemic racism against every race, since there are racist individuals of all colors.\n\n>For example in work places hair styles associated with black people were often restricted or banned, being seen as unprofessional. \n\nSo genuine question: How much is this different from just general standards of professionalism and appearance? Like, if a white person showed up to work with their hair sculpted into the shape of a swan or something, that wouldn\'t be particularly professional. Lot\'s of people view dying hair, or certain piercings to be unprofessional. Those same hair styles would likely still be viewed as unprofessional on white people (no joke, my brother (who is white) has super curly hair to the point where in middle school, he basically had an afro for some reason, for which he got bullied). \n\n>Thing is some of the laws are there to make it easier to go after these people. For example when police conduct a raid on your home they have to only wait 20 seconds after they knock to break down your door I\'m case you flush down evidence. We are arresting people for such a small amount of drugs that you can flush them down the toilet in 20 seconds. \n\nOh yeah, that\'s just stupid. Regardless of racism, weed probably shouldn\'t be illegal at all, let alone arresting people for very small amounts of it.\n\n>Maybe that\'s legit, but the fact that black people are more likely to be in proverty is also part of the system. \n\nThat\'s getting into that discussion on socioeconomic status I mentioned earlier.\n\nTo start things off, I think it\'s important to ask a particular question:\n\nLet\'s say in some alternate timeline, there are no longer any active contributions to systemic racism. Absolutely no one is racist anymore. Yet despite this, disparities in things like income remain because of past discrimination, and how wealth is passed through generations. In this alternate timeline, is there still systemic racism?', '>but if the question ""does systemic racism still exist?"" only requires one person to be racist\n\nOf course not, but why are you trying to create an abstract goal. The point is that the issue is noticeable. That would be like asking why we consider diseases like cancer an issue and what number of cancer deaths we would have to prevent before we treat it like something less deadly like a cold. That\'s kind of outside everyone\'s scope at this moment. \n\n>general standards of professionalism and appearance? Like, if a white person showed up to work with their hair sculpted into the shape of a swan or something, that wouldn\'t be particularly professional.\n\nSaying that some white people might have hair styles deemed inappropriate doesn\'t change the fact that most black hair styles are considered inappropriate and that professionalism had been dictated heavily by what was the standard of beauty for white people. \n\nLike someone having their hair in say dreadlocks, which has significant cultural background shouldn\'t even be compared to someone shaping their hair into a swan. \n\n>In this alternate timeline, is there still systemic racism?\n\nYes because unless we fix things, they won\'t get better.\n\nI often hear the argument that time heals all wounds. \n\nAnd frankly that\'s not true. Time in and of itself does nothing. \n\nIt\'s what done during that time that heals wounds. Your body clots around the wound, closes it up, creates a scab, and eventually it heals. \n\nIf we don\'t do anything to change that thing it will remain the same or at the very least take a much longer time to change.\n\nNot as long as the current system which has people actively attributing it, but more time then if we actively helped it. \n\nThough ultimately it\'s pointless to think about because we\'ll we don\'t live in that world.', "">Of course not, but why are you trying to create an abstract goal.

That's kind of outside everyone's scope at this moment.\n\nMy point wasn't to create an abstract goal, but to ask the question of at what point racism is systemic racism rather than just individual racism. All forms of racism are bad of course, but if the discussion is about systemic racism, it's kinda a necessary question.\n\n>Saying that some white people might have hair styles deemed inappropriate doesn't change the fact that most black hair styles are considered inappropriate\n\nWhen you refer to black hair styles, do you mean the general hair styles of curly, textured hair that black people typically have, or are referring specifically to cultural associations?\n\n>Yes because unless we fix things, they won't get better. \n\nDoes this mean there can be ongoing systemic racism without there being anyone who's racist?"", '>When you refer to black hair styles, do you mean the general hair styles of curly, textured hair that black people typically have, or are referring specifically to cultural associations?\n\nMostly I\'m referring to things like braiding, like dreadlocks or corn rows, hair styles that are actually pretty neat and I the former case has cultural and religious backgrounds but have a bad reputation mostly just because of their association with black people. \n\nThough there is also an issue with natural curly hair that most black woman have where they feel forced or at the very least encouraged to straighten their hair in order to fit in the more white focused convention of beauty in the work place. I\'m a guy, so I wouldn\'t know but I heard that straightening hair actually hurts a good amount. \n\n>Does this mean there can be ongoing systemic racism without there being anyone who\'s racist?\n\nAt this point yes. The systems are already in place. It\'s like someone shooting a gun and then falls off a cliff. Ya the murderer is probably dead, but the bullet is still flying in the air. \n\nSome people say that ""it\'s not enough to be not racism, you have to be anti racist"" in order to encourage people to fix the issues cause by systemic racism because even if racism was gotten rid of completely the damage has still been done several times over.\n \nIf a hurricane hits a town, everything isn\'t better the next day just because its not raining anymore. The damage is still there and you have to also rebuild. \n\nI might be guessing here, but it seems you want a very clean answer or a very clear root of the issue, but honestly there are way too many contributing factors here.']","Seems like the guy was just sealioning, you did a good job there mate.",Rule C - Unclear/Improper Title,format,True

gvf1dp0,Colombia,['What do you think of Arabs?'],"Arabs are scum, hypocrites, parasites. 
I guess 2 of the reasons you don't see them so much in Colombia is because of the strict migration policy and no social security. 

Because they don't like to:

- adjust themselves to the rules and laws

- they don't like the culture. 

- they like to profit from the system like social security (free pay without work). 

- one of the biggest issues for them is women in charge they can't stand that. 


Colombia in this sense has a strict migration policy, to obtain nationality they would need to learn proper Spanish, history, culture, politics, geography and the constitution. 

And all this humiliation for no social security... 

If you ever have traveled to Belgium, France or The Netherlands you'll quickly see why. 

There are parts in these countries where women cannot go outside in a skirt or short pants or without facecover... 
Belgium is the worst, some cities now have gone so far to obey complaints from Arabs, and so certain things are now completely fucked up. 

- they have changed certain things like Christmas market to winter market. 

- some cities have gone so far that if your neighbor is Muslim you are not allowed to put a Christmas tree or decoration in your front yard if it is visible to him. 

I travel a lot to Belgium, France, The Netherlands because it's a hub for my courses and travel routes.

They are invariably right-wing hyper-conservatives and reactionaries.', ""Excuse me but Pinochet supporters are objectively worse than Trump supporters.  \n\n\nRegardless of the mindboggling levels of dogshit that Trump is, Trump isn't a military coupster."", 'Fair enough. my only point was to show how out of touch one has to be to think Pinochet was a good guy.', 'Pinochet was a monster. But look at the Chilean economy now. Was Friedman objectively wrong? Or is he merely guilty by association with a monster?', 'Friedman wasn\'t ""wrong."" He was a conscious manipulator who lied about how things were going in Chile. I already responded to the whole ""but the Chilean economy is doing so well today"" bit. Why would you attribute that to Pinochet instead of, say, the liberal reforms that came after him?', ""Why would you attribute that to Pinochet instead of, say, the liberal reforms that came after him?\n\nWhat makes you think I attribute that to Pinochet rather than the market reforms that came from Friedman's camp both during and after him?"", ""Your previous comment implied that you gave credit to Friedman for modern Chilean economic performance. That's what makes me think that.\n\nAnyway, no, Friedman's policies were what drove Chile into crisis in the early 1980's. Also, what about the lack of democratic agreement over the implementation of Friedman's ideas? Does it mean nothing that it was imposed above and over the will of the people?"", "">Why would you attribute that to Pinochet\n\n>you gave credit to Friedman\n \n>Does it mean nothing that it was imposed above and over the will of the people?\n\nI'm not making a normative argument, but you can do so if you like."", 'You are just playing the same game that people like PEterson play, where you say something without ""saying"" it, and then say ""i\'m not saying that, i\'m just saying X.""

It was not just some article, it was from one of the most prominent economists in the world, who was in fact Milton Friedman\'s star pupil, Andre Gunder-Frank. Recall that Gunder-Frank\'s article used terms like ""economic genocide."" If your perspective on this is that it\'s just ""disagreement,"" then you are really out of touch with the kind of harm that these policies actually do to people. \n\nMilton Friedman was a monster, just as much as Pinochet.

It's dishonest and you know it.

Honestly fuck you and the neurotic train you rode in on if you are going to lump me into a ""dogwhistler"" category just for making a distinction between normative and descriptive reasoning. Just because you feel persecuted when people think abstractly doesn't make you correct, in fact you are just waiving a big sign saying ""I am someone who is afraid of ideas so I need to censor you to feel safe.""

Yes, great economists and thinkers of all stripes disagree with one another. You did exactly zero intellectual lifting by referencing that paper.

gsneoho,Reformed,"['Is it justified to offend Christians in the unlimited, unrestricted manner in which I am choosing to try and convert atheists to Christianity?', 'Method in evangelistic outreach is very important. It is good to be aware of our methods and try to be improve to be more consistent, persuasive, and good servants of the charges God has given us as believers to fulfill. \n\nI do want to offer a point to remember as a response to this statement: ***Ideally I want to convert 1 atheist per month from atheism to Christianity using the psychological technique...***  \n\nI think it is important to keep in mind that actual conversion of an unbeliever is totally dependent upon the will, desire, decree, and work of God opening their eyes to see, ears to hear, and heart to receive his truth. It is God, and him alone, that removes the heart of stone and replaces it with the heart of flesh (Ezekiel 11:19, 36:26). We can evangelize, argue, defend, point, have an answer for every question and objection, and employ the best method(s) for persuasive discussion known to mankind. Yet, these ultimately, in and of themselves, will have no effect on any unbeliever apart from God\'s work and choice to allow our arguments, proclamations, and methods to pierce the heart of an unbeliever. If our goal is simply to convert and have a specific number in mind as if we need to meet a quota, it seems it places a dependence on our approach and method to get the job done when in the end it is God\'s work on the unbeliever that produces any effect or success through our outreach. 1 Cor. 3, especially v. 5-9, makes it clear the role and effect our outreach has on unbelievers. Our job is not to convert but to be faithful with the Gospel and proclaim that message for it is in that Gospel message that has the power to convert (Rom. 1:16). \n\nThe beauty of Christianity is that we do desire all to know the love and grace of God found in Christ and we would love for all to come to know him but it seems Scripture is clear that will not be the case. Some will absolutely deny and reject no matter how persuasive and consistent we are in our outreach. In the opportunities God has provided me to interact with unbelievers, as far as I know, not one has come to faith. Is this because my method and arguments have been meh? Perhaps. Do I need to improve on apologetic methods and approaches? Absolutely. Have I felt like a failure because I could have said X instead of Y or should have went with this argument rather than that argument? Yes sir. Yet, in all my encounters I have prayed beforehand, during, and even after that God by his Spirit would guide my words and use whatever I may say to take some root in the unbeliever. We do not know what or how God will use our encounters to produce any change. He can take the poorest, smallest, and obscure moment and use it convert them. We just must rely on his work and be faithful in and thankful for the opportunities he provides to be used. As others have pointed out here, we cannot nor should attempt to dupe/trick unbelievers to convert. No where in Scripture is it expressed that psychological technique\'s were employed by any follower of Christ or of Christ himself. They simply spoke the truth and preached the Gospel and God\'s Word. Resorting to psychological technique does not seem to me to get at the real problem an unbeliever must be confronted with which is his heart and sin. Christianity identifies the heart of man as his problem. Not psychological techniques.\n\nI commend what u/Rivarg and u/GalaadDanann has stated. Familiarize yourself with biblical foundations for outreach without the goal of denigration to persuade or convert because it is not us who conversion depends. \n\nTo be sure, it is hard to ""know"" the heart, sincerity, genuineness, or intention through reading posts on an online forum. And I am not saying you are simply attempting to meet a quota in your evangelism. I do ""hear"" the desire to reach unbelievers in your post so please understand I write this as encouragement and not discouragement. May God bless your work and outreach.']","I included a link to your comment in this thread I made 5 minutes ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/mfg2vz/will_someone_provide_me_with_a_prayer_that_an/

It was a treaty organization that was founded after the Second World War by states in Western Europe which deemed the USSR to be direct threats to their national security.

It had nothing to do with democratic government or ""shared values,"" which were rhetorical justifications grafted on at a later date for what was ultimately a hard-power/nationalism-driven conflict. \n\nAt the time Turkey had large military, a large population, and a growing economy (it still has all three of these things) and its national security interests were threatened by Russia (this is not the case anymore and Western intervention in Iraq and Syria have hurt Turkish national security interests much more than Russia since the early 2000s).

The purpose of a treaty organization is for the members of the treaty to commit to a common objective. After World War II, it was containing Russia, because none of the European member states of NATO would have been capable of defeating Russia in a military conflict alone. For some reason, perhaps because of the rhetorical justifications for the Cold War offered by a generation of Western leaders, many Westerners now seem to think that NATO is an organization dedicated to spreading the religion, er, ""way of life/system of government"" of the West, not unlike the Roman Catholic Church back in Crusader times. \n\n> My point still stands though, even if the requirements were useless window dressing, if Ukraine wanted to join, why should it be prevented from doing so\n\nThe question could easily be flipped around the other way: why should Ukraine be allowed to join NATO? Ukraine cannot offer anything of value to the organization. It has little economic or military capacity. It is extremely hard territory to defend, and it is directly one the border of NATO\'s mortal enemy and *raison d\'etra*, Russia.

No, you are not. Putin and Russia make you mad so like every ding-bat who gets emotional when it comes to politics you have used the word ""fascist"" as a smear term. This is also true of the ""well-regarded observers"" whom you credit because they tell you what you want to hear. This is a stupid tendency in contemporary politics and it has to stop.

&gt; I could probably list these if you want but it's pretty off topic?

Do not bother. It will represent a reverse-engineered argument and you will make it at a meaningless level of abstraction because you want the smear to stick. Suffice it to say that Russia is not planning to do that stuff that everyone immediately thinks of when they hear the word ""fascist"" like genociding the Jews. 

&gt; Ill-advised but nowhere near a justification for the invasion and annexation of Crimea.

From your point of view no, from Russia's point of view yes because they perceived that they were defending the security of an ethnic Russian minority in a region that was only ceded to Ukraine in 1952 after an extremely hostile regime had come to power in Kyiv. 

&gt; ""Moscow's perspective"" was to desperately secure Sevastopol while Ukraine was in chaos.

Apparently the Ukraine was stable enough that the post-coup parliament was able to issue a direct provocation to the Russian minority in Ukraine by repealing the language-protection law.

&gt; Why did they not invade and seize Donbass in a similar fashion, if they believed that the Russian minority was in clear and present danger (which it wasnt)?

The Russian minority was in danger. That was what the Parliamentary repeal of the language law at the hands of a Bandera-ist government signaled. The Crimea was more viable for a military operation because the share of the population in Crimea that is ethnic-Russian is higher and because it is a peninsula -- a peninsula that was actually Russian territory until 1952 at that. (The share of Russian speakers in two of the Oblasts in Donbas is higher than the share of ethnic Russians because many ethnic Ukrainians in the easternmost two Oblasts are multilingual, and speak both Russian and Ukrainian.) 

&gt; This is a pretty weird, unnecessarily personal, and disgusting allegation. Engage with the argument.

Considering how profoundly ill-informed your entire post was,  I actually demonstrated great restraint. You are essentially vomiting back the echo chamber narrative that Western media and think tank sources have created on the Crimean issue for the past seven years. This is a narrative that is only believable to people who don't know anything about the history of the region and who believe that it started approximately yesterday. It deserves to be taken about as seriously as foreigners trying to justify the succession of the Confederacy during the American Civil War who don't have the whole ""it was about slavery"" context nailed down.

If you are looking for returns on investment, right now there is far too much volatility to even bet on much without more than likely losing your shirt...I greatly enjoy the idea of passive income from dividend investing but the unfortunate part about doing that is that you pay taxes on received dividends over a certain amount (don’t know how much off the top of my head) and if you are just planning on selling those etfs within a year’s time, you will also be looking at paying taxes on any capital gains you may assume upon sale making even a gain risky. Also etfs are actively or passively managed so basically, someone out there will be getting paid to hold and invest your money while you lose a small percentage of your egg for them to do so...you are essentially assuming all the risk so they can go play with your money...if you want to start a dividend investment portfolio, go for it!!!

This is a person who happily, eagerly helped you humiliate and emasculate your BS in every way possible. Emotionally speaking, you held your BS down while your AP raped him. So ask yourself, how could you have warm feelings for anyone who would do such a thing and do it repeatedly? Your BS is correct that you should absolutely hate your AP to death, just as much as you should hate and want to destroy every single part of yourself that was capable of committing such a heinous act against a person who you promised to love and honor. \n\nThe fact that you aren't disgusted, in every way, with every single aspect of your affair, means you still have a ton of work to do before you even reach the point of regret, let alone remorse. You were basically a junkie bailing on your family to go get high and now that you've been forced into rehab, you don't want to confront a reality where you have to take responsibility not only for the things you neglected, but for the extraordinary amount of pain you caused by betraying your loved ones to go sneak off and get your fix. Having to face the wreckage you caused and start trying to rebuild is a whole lot less fun than running away from it and getting high, and spending your time picturing the juvenile fantasy scenario where you and your AP ride off into the sunset to be happy and have hot sex till the end of time is more appealing than facing a man who you destroyed and doing everything in your power to make him feel loved and wanted again.\n\nTo expand on the junkie metaphor, you went off chasing your oxytocin high like a heroin addict going to a drug house. The drug house is a filthy, burned out husk infested with rats but you didn't notice because you got your fix and then you were off in la-la land. The filth you were sitting in didn't bother you, and the fact that you were neglecting your responsibilities and your loved ones didn't matter either because as soon as you had that euphoric feeling running through your veins, the rest of the world stopped mattering. Like a junkie in rehab, you still want to go back to the drug house and sit in squalor because the realities, responsibilities, and mundanities of everyday life just aren't as fun as getting high. And like a junkie in rehab, you have to learn that ignoring real life to chase a high is a destructive, irresponsible, foolish way to live and that it ultimately doesn't get you anywhere you want to be.  \n\nOh and for the love of god, stop responding when your AP contacts you. Ignore, block, and immediately inform your BS. There is no other acceptable course of action. "", ""I ask myself why I don't hate my AP for what happened, all the time. I seem to be blinded by the old feelings that I had for AP.\n\n\n\n\nYou're spot on with the junkie analogy. And if I'm perfectly honest, I've been trying to get my fixes since I was old enough to understand how good it made me feel emotionally, to be wanted by someone else.  I am just starting to try to figure out what I actually want out of life. I've always been letting someone else choose these things for me. I've always adapted to the person I was with. If he liked cars, so did I, if he was into working out, I was a beast in the gym, if he loved to travel, then so did I. If he loved me, then I could love myself too.\n\n\n\n\nI know that's super fucked up. I wish I wasn't like that. I don't know how to change things. ""]","Jesus christ you're hopeless.

Good luck. This is overall a good community who are happy to share wisdom with you and help point out errors in logic. Keep coming back!', 'Thank you for this, I definitely do identify with many of your statements. I started IC last week and honestly I think that\'s what is triggering me wanting to get things out. We have not been to MC, and I\'m not sure he\'ll ever want to do that, although I\'m slowly convincing him of the benefits of IC. Since DDay I think we\'ve both been wanting to move on and pretend nothing ever happened, but that\'s just not possible. He is often triggered by TV shows, commercials, comedians, songs...etc... and it feels like we are back at DDay again.   \n\n\nNow,  ""what are core beliefs I have that made me feel like my needs could or would not be met in my marriage"" is a little tricky for me to approach because I\'m still at a place where I feel like  I am the rotten core that will fester our relationship and he is an innocent. This might not be completely true, he has faults as well as I, but mine are greater. What needs was I not getting? Excitement?!? How embarrassing it is to admit that...', 'First you aren’t rotten to your core. You have some broken beliefs and you made really terrible choices. Your actions are not you AND a you have the opportunity to change and become better through good actions from here out.\n\nSecond, it is helpful if we focus on the impact our choices had to our spouse. If we get stuck feeling sorry for ourselves we can overlook how bad they feel. Doing our work and being there to listen to what we have done to them is what we need to do. It’s ok to feel bad about yourself but just be sure it doesn’t get in the way of the fact above - you get a chance to change and that is helpful to you and to your BS.\n\nThird, yes new and different is exciting. But likely there is something deeper. Excitement can come from our current partners, too, but we chose to get the excitement elsewhere. Why? Why couldn’t we ask our partner for what we wanted? Were we afraid?\n\nMy example is this: I was addicted to pornography for a very long time. It escalated from simple sexual subjects to much more. Heading into the relationship, I already had curiosity about other men in a sexual nature. I was so ashamed of this. I thought to myself “if I tell her she will be so disgusted” and “it is so out of left field. It relates to literally nothing we have ever discussed”. So I had this shameful secret and I what did I do? I acted out through video chats and sexual activity outside my marriage. That led to more shame. That led to more acting out... there is a cycle. Was it exciting to meet a random partner for taboo sexual activity? A bit. Was it dangerous? Very.\n\nNow what if I had shared with my partner? Perhaps she could do nothing about this. Perhaps she would have wanted to do some kind of role play. Perhaps she would have supported me exploring in front of her. Or perhaps she would have said she wasn’t ok with it and we would have discussed that It will be a boundary for me and when the thoughts come up, I will tell her about it but I won’t act on them.\n\nSo many scenarios could have existed but weren’t possible because I never shared. Now that I have shared we still haven’t talked about what to do, but I feel free. I have no secrets left. It is amazing. Someday we will figure it out but the shame cycle is broken for now - as long as I keep no more secrets.\n\nThere are other examples that aren’t as extreme (dominance and submission, risky scenarios, etc) that all were desirable, too btw. I’m not suggesting that only if you have some extreme desire does this cycle occur. And this may not have been the case for you at all. But likely once you cheated the first time you did start a cycle of your own and it’s important to look at it deeper and deeper. Something is there and it will help you heal.', 'Someone out there is brave enough to downvote but not to leave a comment and have a discussion?', '""Your actions are not you"". I opened up my legs, I took of my clothes, I let teh man fuck me. I hid the affair from my husband for 3 years. But that is not me. Are you fucking kidding me? I think that is the thing some people downvoted.\n\nCheating is very very very simple. Selfish choice made to satisfy their own needs before EVERYTHING else. \n\nI think you should stay away from Esther Perel. From what I\'ve read so far, I believe the cheaters will heal just fine from reading her book because it does not give 2 shits about the betrayed. ""Ey as long as cheaters are healed meant that the book is working innit."" That is literally the purpose of the book. It does NOT give 2 shits about healing the BS.', 'First - I do appreciate you voicing your opinions and helping me see where someone would disagree with me.\n\n\nYes I do believe (as well as every mental health professional I’ve spoken to since my affair) that we are not defined by one action in our life. We can heal, we can change. If she is a whore and its over, story written, then there is no hope and she may as well leave. But many people do survive this and become better. So it’s unhelpful to simply say because of those actions that is who she **is** rather than that’s what she has **done**.\n\nNext I disagree that cheating is simple and I think if you look at it that way healing will be really superficial. It’s complex in terms of how a wayward got to that point. What things in their life contributed to those poor boundaries and the feelings of worthlessness that we sought out someone else instead of trusting in our partner and sharing ourselves openly. It’s complex also in how a betrayed feels afterward and how we can rebuild safety and trust. I personally don’t find any of that simple.\n\nHave you read Esther Perel’s book? In state of affairs she frequently repeats that examining what happened in the affair is not condoning infidelity. She does not condone it at all, but she advocates for learning from the mistakes. She has looked deeply at the situations and shared insights both sides of a couple can learn from in terms of what happened. It is difficult as a wayward to understand after the fog “how the f did I get here?” and in my opinion her book is a good resource in beginning to understand yourself. You will notice I still encouraged OP to dig deeper than “excitement” and that’s exactly something I learned from that book. I did not walk away with any feeling of justification.\n\nThank you again for sharing where you disagree with me, it’s helpful that we reason instead of just fling votes at each other.', 'I agree with a lot of what you say except that our actions don\'t define us. Yes they do. To quote an old saying ""actions speak louder than words"". That being said what I think you meant to say is that one action doesn\'t define us forever. If you had an affair that at that time you were having it, it defined you as a cheater. That doesn\'t mean that you cant change. If you truly change then your actions should change as well and those new ones will define the person you are at that moment. \n\nIt is why words mean nothing. Especially to a BS. Your words of assurance meant nothing when covering up the affair, that is why in the healing process they mean nothing now, unless they are backed up by actions (aka changes in behavior and the applications of those behaviors). There must be a lot of conflicting statements amongst therapist because every healing  book I have ever read says that your actions absolutely do define you. It tells you this when they tell you to look into yourself (action), find out why you cheated (action), then work on changing those flaws (action) and in cases of reconciliation help your spouse heal and prove those changes to them (action). By doing all of those actions it can help define you in a better way. I don\'t know if I am explaining this well enough. Does this make sense? I am a BS who has had a successful reconciliation with my WS. It doesn\'t mean I am over it or that it doesn\'t hurt still. It just means that I understand that ultimately his affair was about his flaws not mine and that sometimes good people do very stupid, selfish and awful things.', 'It’s a great clarification. Indeed I didn’t mean to say that actions do not define us but that one action alone is not the sole definition of who we are now and forever. Indeed I lied and I cheated. I am working hard to be trustworthy and faithful but understanding why I took that action. I am not a liar and a cheater but someone who did that and if I can get to the bottom of why I did it, I can never do it again.\n\nI think we both agree and I really do appreciate you adding that bit of clarity. Indeed it’s important distinction. The actions cannot be erased.\n\nThanks!']","Except your whole comment about not being defined by “one” action is completely moot.

The cause of pregnancy is sex. It sure sounds like the democrats will increase access to contraceptives and sex ed, which may just make the subject of sex more trivialized, causing more of it.

**8/15/2014** – started therapy

**3/1/2015** \- quit drinking after breaking my foot at my own Oscar party. 

**1/5/2016** – My friend, Adam, was working at a non-profit and encouraged me to to train for a triathlon with him. I complete a Sprint that year and the next.

**2/25/2019** – gastric bypass surgery. Since then, I’ve lost 160 lbs, gained new strength, connected with my body on a higher level, and have seen a world of possibilities open up that I was blind to before.

**6/21/2019** – fell in LURV with the most wonderful woman and recognized my place in the LGBT community as more than an ally.

**8/30/2020** \- I'm competing with TEAM TO END AIDS (T2) in the **Chicago Triathlon!**

My story as a whole is unique, but each step has been imprinted by others before me and most have faced much darker challenges. Many with addiction issues like alcohol and drugs don’t have access to a therapist or supportive friends &amp; family. Those struggling with their health and/or weight may not have the insurance to afford surgery, or need food subsidies to purchase healthy meals. I’m incredibly grateful for my health and look forward to challenging my body with this Triathlon, but there are still 28,000+ people in Chicago who’s bodies are challenged every day by HIV, and they fight harder for their health than I could ever imagine.

I tell my story not to gain empathy, likes, friends, or followers, but to show another perspective so different from our own and shine a light on the immense privilege so many don't have. Those living with HIV and other chronic conditions need equitable access to services such as housing, health care, and case management in order to stay healthy – many rights we take for granted!

That would fall under my example of ""The only exception to this is when the titles are authoritative when the person themselves lack authority""

&gt;I think that what is even more rude is forcing pronouns on those who don't agree with said interpretation of gender.

Whether or not you think it's rude isn't in doubt. The question at hand is whether or not it IS rude, and whether or not it should be socially acceptable.

If the fact that you think it's rude is enough to prove it is rude, then you've posted this in bad faith, because it would be impossible to change your view. The argument would then be ""it should not be socially acceptable because I don't think it should be"" which is circular. 

You need a defence of why it's rude. I've provided one of why it isn't rude - we already accept the social convention of names being decided by the person to whom they refer. I don't see why this can't/shouldn't extend to pronouns.

&gt;For many people, gender pronouns are a type of authority related title

Again, your argument is circular here. You are arguing that requiring people to use self determined gender pronouns should not be socially acceptable purely because some people think it's not socially acceptable. That's not going to work as an argument, because there are other people who think it is socially acceptable. You need a reason why.

Your argument cannot be ""it should be socially acceptable because certain people want it to be socially acceptable"" because equally, there are people who don't want it to be socially acceptable.

&gt;That gives their personal views the authority in the conversation.

Their personal views already have an authority in the conversation, because it is about them. If someone told you their name was David, and you said ""I'm going to call you Charles"" that'd be stupid, but it'd also be rude.

Social convention already dictates that the person in question has authority over their own identity related descriptors up to the point of authorities titles. If you want to claim that gender is an authoritative title, you'll need to explain why. Having a certain genetic code doesn't give you a rank, a role, or a responsibility.

Even if players only submitted the replays which they won, someone had to have lost.  With enough of a population (of which there is - believe it or not many upload to hotslogs), the data is as credible as the ""real"" data which you are trying to tout.  There is very little uncertainty when thousands of replays are uploaded weekly.  In fact, as a big fuck you to you, I'm going to start uploading replays there again.

Stats tracking is a user issue and the algorithm can be improved if anyone actually cared.  But noone actually cares.  When you log into HotS, you are shown your rank and level.  When you look at the statistics, you can sort between seasons and game modes.  What is the problem here? 

As for ""spam/garbage"" scripts, do you also write to pornhub/yourporn/biqle/[any porn site] admin about adverts and scripts?  And if you log into hotslogs such that it is apparently slowing down your computer, stop torrenting bad porn because it is not the fault of hotslogs.

This case has a lot of nuance that these quick clips from media sites fail to capture.  
Renee Bach, while not medically, was actually surprisingly successful.  In a review done of the malnutrition cases in Uganda of that time period, Uganda's top rated hospital had a death rate of 18 percent, but SHC (her feeding clinic), had a death rate of 11%.
The 2 cases she was sued for involved children she had not seen, was not even in the country when they were there.   The first case was severely I'll and was followed at the clinic by Ugandan physicians and recieved similar care to what he would have recieved in the hospital several hours away, but he died anyway.  The second case was an infant with tuberculosis who was sent away from SHC because they could not isolate him, but he was sent home with food.  He later died at home.
The two cases were reviewed by a Harvard clinician, an expert in malnutrition, who did not assess them to be outside the standard of care.


Do you know why all of this came to light and this clinic (flawed but functional, and demonstrably improving patient outcomes) was shut down?  (Later restarted but now has no funding and Bach gets death threats and left)  Another white woman, Kelsey Nielsen, who was ALSO a missionary to Uganda and a social worker, was disillusioned and became an online social justice champion to get rid of the white 'saviors' in africa.  This person, a bipolar wreck, launched a hit campaign against something she didnt understand.   And news outlets have been complicit in this political correctness campaign (no white saviors) without understanding the first thing about medical care in Africa.   It is NOT America.  There is a MUCH lower standard of care.  Can you check q6 hour phosphorus for refeeding syndrome, lol, no!

This clinic hired Ugandan doctors and nurses to practice there.  It was a permanent clinic, operating for half a decade, not some fly by night , 1 week missionary tent.


  Yes 100 infants died, but this was a LOWER RATE than would have died at the top hospital in the country.  
And now, a functional clinic that was filling a role (post hospital feeding and care for patients that the hospitals refused to accept... AND paying to get children care at hospitals who could not pay) doesnt exist.   How much better.  So much more woke.",Act professionally and decently.,incivility,True

Hawking stated that he thought that capitalism was actually the greatest threat to human civilization, not runaway technological growth.\n\nHawking said that with machines producing everything we need, we humans currently possess the ability to greatly reduce our workload and live lives of great luxury, but that is only if we can share the wealth that technology has created. \n\nHawking believed that the greatest threat to civilization is this path that we are heading down right now with runaway concentration of wealth and a new oligarch joining the existing oligarchy every day. \n\nRight now it is utterly abundant that the path that we are currently on will lead to the hellish future that Hawking is iterating here, where humans all live in poverty, and the only people that have any kind of wealth are those at the absolute top.\n\nIf humans don't do something about the runaway concentration of wealth at the top 1% and indeed the top .1%, we are headed to future where 95% of humans live in abject poverty and the 5% or so who are born into old money have the system rigged in their favor, so they and their descendants will live in spectacular luxury and riches in perpetuity and the rest of us will be scrounging for drinking water. \n\nWe are already grappling with what Hawkings is describing here today with America being in the throws of late-stage capitalism. \n\nWhen I was a kid it wasn't normal for people to have to work 2 or 3 jobs but now it is a regular thing, it's amazing how this normalization of poverty has taken place in America the past 40 years.

&gt; Fake news is, quite simply, news (“material reported in a newspaper or news periodical or on a newscast”) that is fake (“false, counterfeit”).

An opinion is not fake. The fact you dont have a reasonable grasp on what constitutes fake news was kind of a hint that made me realize your giant wall of text was nothing other than a partisan hack well before i started reading. I could spend my time debunking your sites one by one (like how the snopes article explicitly states that there is no evidence of voter fraud in califonia; unsurprising that you couldnt even admit in passing whats happenin in NC with actual election fraud and a recalled election) but i feel as if nothing would get through and my day would start off shitty.

I truly feel sorry that these are the kinds of things your mind focuses on. If you really spent all of this time researching and you use bottom of the barrel sites like ""100percentfedup"" then you really have been lost to the vast disinformation campaign that Schumer is talking about.

Therefore, areas that a biocultural perspective incorporates are biological evolution and influence of diseases cultural interpretation of illness and critical approach analysis of diseases in the society (Leatherman,& Hoke, 2016). Therefore, the biocultural perspective studies cultural health and healing base on traditional experience, gender, age, class, and education.

It is the responsibility of those with privilege to educate themselves and resist systemic discrimination against others. It’s not just “abusive jerks” who are the problem, but also allistic people who unknowingly contribute to institutionalized oppression & micro aggressions. I think “cult-behavior” doesn’t accurately describe this content. The “in group” you would reference is not autistic people, but rather allistic & autistic allies who recognize this political/social imbalance.']","You can't expect everyone to educate themselves. People will be people. Now most mean well and if you tell them your story while they are receptive they will learn. It is purely a case-by-case basis. Also some people are just naturally resistant to such change and input. Should they be aware of it? yes. Is it their responsibility? maybe in a perfect world but not this one.

We are all responsible for our own happiness and the of the one's we choose to take responsibility for. For instance I don't expect my neighbor to have my back on anything just because they are my neighbor. I don't know them and I don't understand them. If I wanted to I would try or they would try. So far it's us living our own lives trying to find our own happiness/balance. I think we are doing quite well in the balance category.

All in all I have low expectations that pretty much meet the law and common decency (example: holding the door open for someone, paying it forward when you can/when you want to, tipping more than normal, picking up that hitchhiker occasionally, etc).  I don't expect someone on the street to know the ins and outs of PTSD, autism, anxiety-disorder or any of them. I HOPE they are aware of it and are receptive enough to learn more about it. But I don't think it's really their responsibility.

On another topic though mental health should be taught in schools to more of an extent. I know a lot about STD and a decent amount of the human circulatory system but had to teach myself or have a therapist teach me what PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and autism was (USA, education system BTW). The only thing they really touched on was suicide/Depression.

Those are my thought's though. I agree people with mental illness is discriminated against and people in cretin positions should be educated more on it (I.E. employers, teachers, medical professions and some more) but I don't think the 7/11 clerk has a responsibility to know  the differences.

Tips to totally dominate the Contest!!!
The key to this game is half be a baller of a fighter and second, acquire the best heroes to use. Don’t be afraid to search YouTube for how to fight (like how do I intercept &amp; parry) and how to use certain characters. 
1. Only use units to build your mastery tree (do not buy any crystal deals). Search masteries by Brian Grant or Seatin on YouTube. Unlock parry and dexterity first (under utility)
2. Best 5-hit combo. Medium (swipe towards), light, light, light, medium. And then either block (parry) and then start another 5-hit combo or bait out their special
3. Chain your special on the tail end of your five hit combo. You have to be quick
4. Do not burn your catalysts ranking up just anyone. Use on God Tier champs (according to Seatin)
5. Join an alliance when possible. Make sure to stay active in Alliance Quest (this is how you get catalysts to rank up) &amp; Alliance Wars (this is how u unlock shards to get 4* &amp; 5* heroes). It is better to be one of the worst guys in an awesome alliance than to be a top dog in a lame alliance 
6. Play the monthly event quests first. They only run 30 days. Do as hard of a difficulty setting as you can handle. Then play catalysts quests. Then play the normal story mode last. 
7. Do not open your hourly (4 hr) crystals. Simply claim them. Save them for when you run out of revives &amp; are stuck in a quest, then open. 
8. If you are going to lose a fight and did not hardly take off any of the enemies health,  close out the app. About half the time, the game will just restart the fight. 
9. If you don’t want to grind, consider buying an account or pay a merc. Any questions add me on Line. My ID is StuCor",Solicitation (including account selling),spam,True

Are there harmful chemicals in cigar smoke?

Yes. Cigar smoke, like cigarette smoke, contains toxic and cancer-causing chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Cigar smoke is possibly more toxic than cigarette smoke (3). Cigar smoke has:

A higher level of cancer-causing substances: During the fermentation process for cigar tobacco, high concentrations of cancer-causing nitrosamines are produced. These compounds are released when a cigar is smoked. Nitrosamines are found at higher levels in cigar smoke than in cigarette smoke.

More tar: For every gram of tobacco smoked, there is more cancer-causing tar in cigars than in cigarettes.

A higher level of toxins: Cigar wrappers are less porous than cigarette wrappers. The nonporous cigar wrapper makes the burning of cigar tobacco less complete than the burning of cigarette tobacco. As a result, cigar smoke has higher concentrations of toxins than cigarette smoke.

Furthermore, the larger size of most cigars (more tobacco) and longer smoking time result in higher exposure to many toxic substances (including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ammonia, cadmium, and other substances).

Cigar smoke can be a major source of indoor air pollution (1). There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. If you want to reduce the health risk to yourself and others, stop smoking.

Do cigars cause cancer and other diseases?

Yes. Cigar smoking causes cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lung. It may also cause cancer of the pancreas. Moreover, daily cigar smokers, particularly those who inhale, are at increased risk for developing heart disease and other types of lung disease. Regular cigar smokers and cigarette smokers have similar levels of risk for oral cavity and esophageal cancers. The more you smoke, the greater the risk of disease (3).

I'm not asking people here to become fans of Catholicism, just to respect your Catholic patients and to respect the fact that they have religious beliefs that they take seriously in their own lives. 

And FWIW (apologies if this is overly personal): I went without regular medical care for about ten years in my young adulthood, largely because I was genuinely scared about being treated badly by doctors who may have had problems with my Catholicism.

It creates a snow ball effect where people are able to have an insane amount of debt relative to their income and it’s all government back mortgage securities.\n\nWe should make a rule - one home, your primary home, gets the secured mortgage.  Every other property should be treated as a speculative investment and you should pay the exact same interest as if you went to the bank and said you wanted to borrow 300,000 to invest in stocks.', "">We should make a rule - one home, your primary home, gets the secured mortgage.  Every other property should be treated as a speculative investment and you should pay the exact same interest as if you went to the bank and said you wanted to borrow 300,000 to invest in stocks.\n\nHuh? Really? The banks are happy to lend at low rates on homes because, unlike your margin account, they are less risky. Why would we set an arbitrary price floor on loans? I'd be in favour of taking CMHC out of the equation for second mortgages, but regulating private loans seems silly."", 'I’m not suggesting changing regulations on private loans.\n\nI’m suggesting that loans for the purpose of investment should be considered as private loans.    \n\nYou shouldn’t be able to buy a unfinished condo for 200k, put it immediately up for sale at 400k and then borrow 200k of equity on it.', ""Maybe I'm missing something here, but are loans for purposes of investment (including, investment in real estate) not already considered private loans? If I buy a property, I go to the bank, and they lend me 80% of its value in the form of a mortgage, what about that was different than me asking to borrow X% of my stock portfolio value? \n\nAs for the condo, I don't know what that example was. How can one buy a condo for 200k, list it for 400k, and borrow 200k of equity? That's not how mortgages work. \n\nIt's more like I bought a house for 500k, with a 400k mortgage, the house is now worth 1.5m and I've re-leveraged it, borrowing an additional 500k, which I've used to go and make 5, 100k downpayments on condos, each with their own 400k mortgage as well."", 'You can take out a mortgage on your home based on about 80% of your home value.\n\nIf your home value is skyrocketing (from 200k to 400k) 80% of 400k is 320k.  It is perfectly possible to buy a property valued at 200k for 40k and then two or three years later be able to take out 280k of equity.\n\nThis would be a secured loan, at a mortgage rate.\n\n280k of equity would allow you to make a down payment on virtually any home.\n\nI know someone who owns four homes and has an income of about 190k.  190k income would not be enough to qualify him for a 1.8 million dollar loan, but he’s managed to take equity out of each of his homes to finance the down payment on the next, never selling the previous only renting it out.\n\nKeep in mind - over half of his income is rental income from 5 units (1 condo, two homes with main floor unit and basement unit).  If he didn’t have five renters, he’d be in foreclosure.  Even with five renters, he’s not making a profit at all.  But the values of his properties have increased to the point where he’s looking at being able to buy a sixth home based on another equity take out.', 'You just described exactly what I described above.. and not at all what you had previously commented (*""You shouldn’t be able to buy a  unfinished condo for 200k, put it immediately up for sale at 400k and  then borrow 200k of equity on it""* is not what you just described).\n\nAlso, you seem confused about what a secured loan is.

There are literally three condos going up near me that are entirely sold out with units already up for resell and the buildings are not even completed yet.  Condo prices here are going up so fast you could easily expect to take equity out of a brand new build within 2 years.\n\nObviously secured loans are at a lower rate.  However the assumption behind the lowered rate is that the secured loan is going to improve the property - renovations, repairs, a secured line of credit to buy furniture.  Using a secured line for speculative investment is dangerous because it allows people with low incomes to leverage immense debts (as you clearly understand).\n\nI have no problem with a secured line being used to reroof an old house.  I do have a problem with a secured line being used to invest.  If you’re not using the line for the property, you shouldn’t be able to secure it with the property.  You should have to get the loan legitimately.', '> However the assumption behind the lowered rate is that the secured loan is going to improve the property - renovations, repairs, a secured line of credit to buy furniture.\n\nThis is where you’re misunderstanding. The bank doesn’t care. As long as your loan to value remains reasonable, they don’t care how you spend the money, since they can repossess the house (collateral) if needed. \n\nI’m sorry you feel secured loans shouldn’t be used for things other than home improvements, but that’s just not how it works. \n\nYour condo example also keeps flip flopping between immediately and two years from now. It’s either immediate or it’s not.', 'No, that’s where your misunderstanding.  I know the bank doesn’t care what you use the money for.  I’m saying that they should.\n\nMy entire argument is that you shouldn’t be able to use sky rocketing home prices as a substitute for actual income.  It creates an unstable market where people are buying up homes they don’t need and forcing up the prices to unsustainable levels to take the equity from the home.  It creates massive leverage in a market that’s supposed to be stable and well regulated.\n\nIs your only argument nitpicking the exact length of time it takes to take equity out of a condo?

I'm sorry you feel this way, I completely understand.  
I've lost my brother a few years ago and I still find myself on days feeling extremely low.  
Grief is a journey that I wish we could finally end but it becomes more of something we learn to live with, we cope with.

It's going to be hard, I'm not going to lie but I swear it's worth fighting through.  
It sucks, it really does and Im sorry.  
I want you to know though, its okay if you're angry, pissed  
ITS OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY  
take your time with these emotions, it's not going to turn off and ignoring it isn't going to be healthy in the long run

Love and light to you.

&gt; The Senate GOP leader didn’t explain his objection from the Senate floor but he has warned for weeks that he will not bring up a government funding bill unless it’s the product of an agreement between congressional Democratic leadership and President Trump.

&gt; ""The solution to this is a negotiation between the one person in the country who can sign something into law, the president of the United States, and our Democratic colleagues,"" McConnell said Tuesday when he blocked a House bill as well as a piece of legislation to fund DHS through Feb. 8.

Korea doesn\'t really get monsoons, those are more of a South East Asia thing, while Korea\'s weather is more comparable to a place like Michigan. That being said, in late July to early August, there is a 3 week span where there will be a half dozen rainy days which people call the rainy season. \n\nLast year however was absolutely bonkers. We had 40 straight days of rain, over which three typhoons hit the peninsula. A normal typhoon season might see 1-2 typhoons make landfall, as most of them curl back and hit Japan or loop south and hit the Philippines. Last year though we had I wanna say 5 or 6 total. \n\nAdditionally this winter has been one of the absolute wettest in a long while. Korea used to be known as quite a snowy place, but for the past decade or so, it mostly has been snow-free with only 1-3 snowfalls all winter, with the snow almost never sticking around longer than maybe a day.

That in and of itself is remarkable.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of people are going to be very happy with a bit of the 6xx warmth shaved off-- I don\'t see how this is a ""step back"". I found the tuning considerably more pleasing out of the box when compared to the 660S, which is way too dark. Even so, the 560S can hardly be called a ""bright"" headphone.\n\nFinally, resolution is worse than the 660S but certainly not by any large margin. It\'s definitely a lot better than the 58X which is extremely grainy in the treble.

While they might not sound the same, they are unquestionably a Sennheiser headphone, with a very similar base tuning. The 560S is essentially what the 58x was on launch, except that it sounds quite a bit better than the 58x (in my opinion).\n\nThe same people looking to buy a 6xx will also consider the 560S, and I think many will go for the 560S simply because of the better soundstage and slightly more analytical tuning."", ""Soundstage and imaging is a joke on most headphones, even HD 800 STILL sounds like headphones, prioritizing soundstage and imaging beyond a certain point is a meme IMO, want actual good imaging and soundstage?

Once they complied, they were trapped. They could leave only with the permission of the government’s Indian agent. Aboriginal women were raped. Men could not farm or hunt because they had no land and no freedom. If they complained, their rations were cut. Even if they were pliant, the food was substandard. One contaminated shipment triggered a mass outbreak of tuberculosis.\n\n* None of this was accidental. Daschuk found the directives Macdonald sent to federal officials telling them to deny food to them to First Nations. **He found public statements in which Macdonald boasted about keeping the indigenous population “on the verge of actual starvation” to save government funds.** He tracked the infected food shipment to its source, an American company in which a senior official of the Canadian government had a large financial stake.""\n\n>It existed prior to his taking on the role as administrator. \n\nGood lord, he ran it as Minister of Indian Affairs and Prime Minister.

Good lord. \n\n>While his opponents in parliament wanted to cut off food from them entirely, due to the cost, he boasted about keeping them on the verge of starvation.\n\nThis is not true. His ""verge of starvation""was in response to criticism by David Mills, his own former Superintendent of Indian Affairs, that Macdonald had created a welfare state with his ethnic cleansing scheme. Nobody ever asked him to commit the atrocity faster. \n\nBut what an argument, even if your contention was true: at least he killed those thousands of innocents slowly! He could have done it faster, it\'s true, but its the whole ethnic cleansing of thousands of innocents that tends to get people upset, rather than the speed it was executed. \n\n>It wasn\'t his creation\n\nYes it was. From [Professor Carlton](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/07/09/john-a-macdonald-was-the-real-architect-of-residential-schools.html): \n\n>Rather, the person ultimately responsible for planning and bringing about the system — its architect — is Macdonald. In the late 1870s, Macdonald dreamed of creating an organized system of federal schools for Indigenous children that could be used to disrupt Indigenous lifeways and control over the land to accelerate successful settler colonialism.\n\n>As such, he appointed a friend, Nicholas Flood Davin, to investigate the success of boarding schools for Indigenous peoples in the United States and determine how it could be replicated in Canada. Impressed by American policies of “aggressive assimilation” through residential schooling, Davin published his report in 1879. Beginning shortly thereafter, Macdonald adopted Davin’s recommendation to create residential schools to help eradicate Canada’s so-called “Indian problem.”\n\n>In May 1883, two weeks before Langevin delivered his infamous speech, Macdonald laid out the aim of the schools in the House of Commons. He argued, “When the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write … [T]he Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.”\n\n>he ran it briefly.\n\nHe was the responsible minister for 9 years. \n\n>Yes, and he granted the vote to natives who wanted it, \n\nSo when he removed the franchise from all indigenous people resident in \n\n>Manitoba, British Columbia, Keewatin, and the North-West Territories, and any Indian on any reserve elsewhere in Canada who is not in possession and occupation of a separate and distinct tract of land in such reserve, and whose improvements on such separate tract are not of the value of at least one hundred and fifty dollars,""\n\nIt was because that enormous group of people just didn\'t want the vote. Really? That\'s your argument? \n\n>considering the relationship between the Commonwealth and China at the time, not at all shocking.\n\nDisenfranchising people is pretty bad dude. ', ""> So you're aware of all the concentration camp stuff but think the above quote you provided is a suitable response? \n\nIs it a concentration camp, or a resettlement camp? That depends on whether or not you believed it would have been best to allow the indigenous population to attempt to continue living its traditional way of life upon territories bereft of their traditional food sources.\n\nSure, JAM _could have left them to starve on the prairies_. I doubt you would prefer that, though.\n\n> Nobody ever asked him to commit the atrocity faster.\n\nNobody other than the official opposition, who saw the expenditure as a needless waste that would cause the native population to become hopelessly dependent upon the state.\n\n> Impressed by American policies of “aggressive assimilation” through residential schooling\n\nAnd such residential schools were already in operation in Canada; the Federal Government brought them into the program.\n\nEncouraging others to copy a program that he believed to be successful, and utilizing existing schools to do so, hardly makes for a stirring conviction nor evokes the conviction that John A masterminded the affair.\n\n> He was the responsible minister for 9 years.\n\nA small fraction of the lifetime of the dismal endeavour.\n\n> So when he removed the franchise from all indigenous people resident in\n\nHe removed nothing, they never had it to begin with; he gave it to some who never had it.

If I wrote a guide (or searched for one) I\'d be incredibly happy to find a guide that starts with ""open a command prompt"".  First I can copy+paste it rather than looking at a screen shot, figuring out which sub-menu they navigated to, and clicking there.  It\'s just way easier to ctrl+c, ctrl+v.  Plus UI designers seem to change the UI every 6 months, so if I write a guide with screen shots, it\'s probably obsolete for half the users in under 2 years.

That's kind of where the majority of my annoyances are. That's part of why I used the ""rename a USB"" drive example. It's a scenario where every major desktop environment (XFCE, Gnome, KDE, last time I checked them) basically decided it wasn't their problem. There's __tons__ of examples I could give you if I had to sit down in front of a Linux desktop environment for a day or two, but they typically feel like that.

It's not that I need to use a command line, it's that __only in Linux do I need to use a command line__.

On my fileserver, the command line stuff is fine. Any time you have a headless system, text entry is acceptable. It's an expected interface.

On a desktop operating system, it's not expected. In the slightest. So when simple things require a command line entry, it feels like you're working with an incomplete system.

Apologies for the car analogy, but if your kit car required a _hand crank_ to start up, instead of the DC startup motor we've basically taken for granted for the last six decades, you'd probably think it was an incomplete device. That's basically how I feel in desktop Linux whenever a simple operation requires a terminal command. It feels like I'm not using a desktop OS at all, just a crummy facsimile of one.



> SIDE NOTE: Now that said, ___even in CLI___, GNU's amalgamation of programs are a usability clusterfuck, which becomes obvious the moment you try teaching someone how to use the command line environment. Little things, like:

>* mkvmerge explicitly requires an output flag. ffmpeg explicitly requires an input flag. Both make assumptions about the inverse. **Why in the f-**
* `dd` under BSD fails if you use an uppercase letter for your blocksize, like 8M. `dd` under GNU fails if you use a lowercase letter for your blocksize, like 8m. **Neither one** needs fucking case sensitivity for any practical reason.
* ""Just read the man page""! Cool, but how about you fuckers **make a consistent fucking format for command examples first**?
* 7z is one of the very few programs that includes a **single fucking example** of a command being run to do X under Y circumstances. No variable names, no brackets, just, how a command would run to archive a folder. That should not be a **rare occurrence**.
* STOP MAKING ANY FUCKING FLAGS THAT REQUIRE AN ARGUMENT DIRECTLY AFTER THEM WITH NO SPACES. IT'S STUPID. STOP FUCKING DOING IT. JESUS FUCKING CHR-
* I don't even wanna **start** with Blender's command line rendering argument order requirements
* Pretty much fucking **everything** about writing a tar command, and how it basically ignores flags if they're not in the right order, without actually telling you.

Borderlands was the progenitor of the looter shooter, which used a novel art style (for a video game, I know they stole it from elsewhere), and was thoroughly unique. 

Borderlands 2 is a vast improvement over the first, with a unique setting and decent story. The writing was cringy at times, but Handsome Jack is a super memorable villain.

Destiny and Destiny 2 had abysmal starts but evolved into great albeit thoroughly flawed games. They feel fantastic. They're terrible at delivering the story through the game, but if you familiarize yourself with the lore, it's actually a sprawling world for which the games are a frustratingly small lens. On top of that, Bungie's art is top tier. From skyboxes to set-pieces, Destiny is just plain pretty.

Those are my touchstones for the genre. I'm assuming you're probably also referring to The Division and Anthem, at the very least. Both of which I skipped (more into FPS than 3PS). Are there others you have in mind?",No Attacks / Witch-hunts / Bigotry / Inflammat...,harassment,False

Think of it this way, the class skill tree is a way to **passively** augment your character, while item mods **actively** alter the way you can play. Just for reference I\'m currently leveling a Devastator and that\'s the skill tree I\'m looking at as I write this, so the skills I\'m using as examples are from that class. The classes are all very unique, so keep that in mind. It\'s also important to note that the game very much promotes being aggressive, for many reasons, one being that all classes heal (in some way) by doing damage and/or killing.\n\nEach of the 4 classes has 3 skill trees. You have 8 skills total and can equip 3 at a time, and can swap them freely. It\'s true that some of the **small** nodes are general things like increased skill leech, increased max health, various resistances, armor, bleed damage/duration, crit damage, etc. There *are* also quite a few more specialized **small** nodes that vary based on the class. Things like increased damage when enemies are below x% health, increased resists by x% for each enemy nearby, increase health regen by x% of your max health, increase *close ranged* weapons damage, etc. Things that can potentially boost or influence specific playstyles and builds.\n\nThe bigger nodes go even further into boosting different playstyles, with things like gaining 20% of an enemies armor for 10 seconds after killing them in close range, being healed for 25% of your bleed damage, increase all healing and shielding by 20% for you and allies, increased weapons damage by 70% for 10 sec after using kinetic abilities, and **many** more examples. There are also some more general large nodes too, like increasing damage mitigation after using certain skills, a cheat death, extending the distance that is considered ""close range"", increasing firepower by 15% of your anomaly power, increasing armor bonus by 40% of your anomaly power, etc., but even these can be used to great effect. There are also some large nodes that let you target specific weapon types, increasing damage and drop rate of said item.\n\n**BUT**, like I said in the beginning, the biggest element of skill customization comes from **GEAR**! Combining your skill tree with the possibilities from gear lets you do some very cool stuff. I\'ve played every other looter shooter, and I don\'t remember any other having gear that was this *meaningfully* impactful on your gameplay from such a low level.\n\nGear can and will completely change the way your class plays later on, but it actually *starts* doing this fairly early on as blue weapons are the first to get **Mods**, which are split into weapon and armor mods. There are at least 70 different weapon mods, and at least 174 different armor mods. Assuming it\'s not more than 174 and even distribution between the 4 classes, that\'s around 43 mods per class, and 5 per skill.\n\nI\'ll just list the mods on the low level blues I\'m wearing as a (bad) example. I have a sniper with a mod that increases my weapon leech by 20% for 20sec on kill, then I can use an ability to leap slam in from distance, and swap to my SMG with a mod that causes my shots to explode for small AOE damage. I have a mod that causes kills with earthquake to restore 10% of health to all nearby allies, one that gives my earthquake an extra charge making it easier to get those kills, one that causes all bullets I reflect to cause bleed and another that adds vulnerability.\n\nThose are just low level mods I\'ve found going through the story without even trying to make a build yet, but I\'ve already been able to throw together a fun and effective one with the random stuff I\'ve found, and I\'m not even in full blue gear. As you progress you\'ll get better gear with new and better mods, you\'ll have more mod slots to work with, which will allow for more synergies, etc. And that\'s not even getting into legendaries.\n\n**And best of all, the crafting makes experimenting with all of these fun!** When you disassemble items with mods, the mods get permanently added to your collection, which allows you to craft them onto different items. It\'s a very nice way to keep you from being at the mercy of RNG when it comes to playing a particular build you\'re enjoying. ANYWAY, the crafting system is awesome and could be its own post, and I\'ve already gone on for **WAY** too long. Sorry for the wall of text. Hopefully at least one part of my rambling will be useful to someone. Cheers.', ""Excellent write-up and I completely agree about this game having a really fun loot and modding system. Although it doesn't have high production values they have somehow managed to create the best loot system in a looter shooter of this type i think.\n\nFor example, I don't like using shotguns, they aren't bad but i'm playing a technomancer so i benefit more from long range weapons. If I get a cool shotgun with nice mods, it's not worthless cuz I can dismantle it for the mod and just swap it into a sniper rifle I like. Or if I get a green armour piece with excellent base stats, I just upgrade its rarity and slot in a useful mod. Seeing green rarity loot drop isn't disappointing cuz there's still a possibility to make it great. That meaningful decision-making is available from quite early on and isn't only for end game like so many other looter shooters."", 'I’m playing trickster and there’s seriously some amazing combinations you can do.

fshsgys,loseit,['About 94 lbs down from 400lbs in 305 days. Nearing 100 lbs lost.'],"I want to answer this, but I feel like I can only answer it in a very specific way. I apologize in advance if anything I say makes me come off as a maniac. It might be true - maybe I am maniacal, but this is how I've managed to keep a tight grip on everything for the better part of an entire year.

A couple of years ago (specifically the entire school year of 2017-2018; it was my first year at a big university), I essentially hit what I considered to be an emotional rock bottom. The physical rock bottom was present too, but that was more like a default mode that I had lived with for so long that it basically wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Before that school year, I had spent a few years at community college, where I suppose you could say I found myself. I'm a trombonist, and my major is music education. Before college, I felt worthless pretty much 24/7. Lived in the background, didn't really have any meaningful friendships, had a history of being bullied in elementary and middle school that haunted me for a while. All of that changed in community college. I made a positive reputation for myself, gained confidence in my sense of life direction, and I loved/love all of the friends I made there.

All of that changed in the school year of 2017-2018. Where I decided to attend school ended up being quite a goliath in terms of expectations of music students, and I was failing to keep up with it during that year. What I got from it wasn't immediately registered as a productive sort of failure to me, but more of a dead end. It was a dead end that resulted in me losing faith in my direction, faith in the meaning of my life, faith in any possible connections I could possibly have with other human beings, and faith in my own ability as a trombonist. Needless to say, I eventually learned to adapt to what the school wanted from me, but at the time, my mental health came to a screeching halt.

I had come back from school that summer, and with my experiences in failure combining with some major family issues I was having at the time, my mind ended up in an extremely dark place with which suicide was not an unordinary thought. I won't go into too much detail here, but I remember the exact moment that my mind had sort of an epiphany in the middle of a chaotic episode with my family that something needed to change and it needed to change right there and then. So for the entirety of the next year, with a lot of help from friends and mentors, I learned what it meant to love myself and to accept myself for everything I was and for all of my flaws.

It took me an entire year of working on my mental health (not even doing any work on my body) to come to the conclusion that I was worth the love I denied myself for so long. I mention in the post that this has been a 305 day journey, but when I rightfully include the entire year it took for me to purge the other demons I was dealing with, it's actually been a 670 day journey. With my revelations in mental health, I've come to the conclusion that we are all inherently valuable. And if we are all inherently valuable, then I am inherently valuable, and that value means that I need to do right by my body and take care of it. I suppose you can say that is something akin to my creed.

My physical journey hasn't been perfect. I've been prone to what may appear as (and what may actually be) psychotic episodes due to seemingly long term halted progress - crying and throwing fits on my bathroom floor, or crying myself silently to sleep while visiting my family, but those things happened much, much, much more often way earlier on. I've since then learned to apply that creed I spoke of to this process, and what that means to me is that the creed will always overrule the immediate feelings I'm experiencing.

I've rationalized this bottom line: **I have to keep going. I will not stop. Being upset, not seeing progress, or not being in the mood to continue are not excuses to stop, because if I don't keep going for me, nobody will.**",Be Good to One Another,incivility,False

It didn’t kill me, so I suppose it made me stronger.

While exercise is important for weight loss, don’t lose sight of the reality that it’s mostly what happens in the kitchen that decides how your body will treat you.

OP stated in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jcsotn/aita_for_saying_no_thanks_when_my_parents_told_me/g949qf9/) he makes his siblings breakfast, wakes them and does an hour of chores every day already, on top of that he has a job and only two hours of time for himself with school and work.

Hi, *NoseOk738*!

Unfortunately, [your comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/mrfm0o/-/gunftkc/) has been removed from /r/teenagers for the following reason***(s)*** listed below:

>#2. No spamming.


>**a. Irrelevant Memes**


> * Image macros, memes, copypastas, videos, etc. that are not specifically relevant to the average teenager may be removed. Memes must relate to daily teenaged life; they shouldn't be applicable to other subs or every day people. For example, if it's relatable to someone who is not a teen, it's not suitable for this sub. If it's a funny meme that has no relevancy to specific teenaged experiences, it's not suitable for this sub. Please check you are using the appropriate subreddits.


>**b. Spam**


>* Posts with intent to spam and clog /new/, and/or intent to collect karma including cake day posts are not allowed. Post deemed to be spamming /new/ such as personality tests or question threads are subject to removal if necessary whether or not there is a megathread created to contain these posts. Reposts or extremely similar memes are subject to removal.

>* Submissions that do not create relevant discussion are not allowed. Posts such as ""why was this user banned""; ""why aren’t my posts showing up?""; screenshots of Reddit including a user's profile, r/teenagers or other subs, posts, comments, etc; or images that lack any context fall under this rule.


>**c. Comment spam**


>* Comments with the intent to spam by extremely large messages, copypastas, or multiple repeated comments throughout the sub are subject to removal.


The full extended documentation of Rule 2 can be found on [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/wiki/rules#wiki_2._no_spamming.), as the quote block above is our simplified version for ease of reading.*

As long as religion is not instrumentalized for political ends, acting as an opium for the masses, or coopted with nationalism, then a person could believe in whatever they want. Now, historically, Orthodox Christianity has been subject to radical uprooting during the Russian revolution. There where some understandable motivations given that religion was seen as an obstruction for materially transforming the world, and some felt like religious peasantry was in the way. That does not mean that the way these people were dealt with is entirely justified. There was some excess in violence which is not justifiable and that is something that Marxists have to critique, acknowledge and study so such mistakes won’t happen again. Moreover, you act as if communism is some form of a genocide project when it was precisely the opposite; during the Russian and Chinese revolutions, minorities (jews, mongols, etc.) enjoyed the greatest equality that they had prior in history. There are certainly more tension with religion. Especially today where the Orthodox church serves as political subsidiary of Russian government power. When sovereignity is combined with religion, that is where you repression and stagnation of production of opium for the mind.

This is, and still why we were in this state even tho technology has advance at a insanely rapid rate. Because we can never see past our current system, and ourselves.

One is societal inertia. While US does a lot for social mobility, it\'s not perfect, and ones birth is a factor on ones future income, because of schools / connections etc. Because systemic racism existed 50 years ago, we are still seeing some after effects of it. It doesn\'t mean that systemic racism still exists, it just means that these things take time to work out.  \n\n\nThe other point is that skin color has actually surprisingly little to do with incomes. The ""richest skin color"" in US is Asian, not Caucasian. Black overall are in the last place, but one group in particular, Nigerian Americans, is actually very wealthy - on average Nigerian Americans make \\~20% more than average.

Not only that, short of full on communist-style command-and-control regime that regulates every single aspect of peoples lives, I am not even sure it\'s possible to create a society where there was no some reasonable differences based on ethnicity.

Jim Crow was system racism. Segregation was systemic racism. Rules that restrict Asian American participation in college admissions are modern example of tiny but real systemic racism. If there were laws or rules or procedures today that say - if someone is black, police officer can arrest them without cause - that would\'ve been systemic racism. On the other hand, NBA isn\'t... the fact that most players are African American doesn\'t imply that others are discriminated against.  \n\n\nIt\'s a more useful definition, because it\'s actionable.

Bc the writing style is very specific and very broad on those types of programs.

I'm well familiar with the whole Terry Rossio ""Crap + 1"" article and all the like. But I think this is actually a distinct / separate question. For example, most all my samples are tonally premium cable/streaming and that's where my reps are steering me. I actually did write a broadcast-y pilot that could be single or multi-cam and they basically ignored it. I don't think they've submitted me for anything broadcast, partly bc that's not my particular interest (though I'm not against it per se) and I think partly bc it's not my manager's taste (though I don't think she's against it per se either). Also in all fairness it's not like my reps are telling me every project they submit me for.

So I do wonder if a writer is interested in working on, as a random example, Chuck Lorre-style half-hour's what they ought to be writing and how it would be evaluated by industry types (many of whom personally don't share that specific taste).

gr940s9,startups,['Hiring UX/UI designer before Development team?'],"You'll get much more accurate estimates with complete blueprints:

* Product Specifications
* Wireframes
* User Flows
* User Stories

These make it explicitly clear what you want to be built, how it should work, and why you want it to function in that manner.

This also allows for the engineers to do what they do best in figuring out the best manner to accomplish what you want or help you adjust for limitations in what's possible given the tech and the budget.

Furthermore, as I mentioned in my other comment, the exercise of doing this will help you scope things down much more effectively as you are working off of the more complete vision of what you want and able to better understand where you could and should cut back to arrive at a suitable MVP, as lean as possible, to start with. You will have a better sense of what is core and most important to start with as your foundation.

You SHOULD do as much of this as you possibly can on your own before you bring on ANYONE else. Even a UX designer.

Do all you can to the best of your ability. Even if that is on a whiteboard or with paper and pencil. It doesn't need to be pixel-perfect. It just needs to be good enough to clearly communicate the vision and these details of what, how, and why.

Ideally, you'll sketch every state of every UI element on every screen with notations providing the Product Specification information along with those mockups.

If you bring on a UX designer after doing as much as you can, they'll be able to hit the ground running and you'll save lots of time and money working with them, too.

You don't need to worry about your mockups resulting in an estimate coming back with too high of a price tag.  You just need to scope things down. Again, you'll be much better equipped to do so while working off of actual mockups than simple product specifications.

If all you do is provide the Product Specifications you're leaving far too much room for interpretation and the estimates will be wildly different from one person/firm to the next. They'll come to the own conclusions as to what you mean. Hell, even the same person/firm may draw different conclusions from the same Product Specifications a few days apart as they interpret things differently.

# For those unaware:

**Product specifications**

* This is a very comprehensive document that explains every feature in your product. It outlines each feature, goes into great detail about what that feature is, what its purpose is, how it relates to other features, and how it supports the overall purpose of the product/service in delivering a specific experience and benefit to the user/customer. You could think of this as a script in movie production.

**Wireframes**

* These are rough visual mockups of your product. In software, it is a mockup of a screen. It shows the layout and all the UI elements on the screen. Complete wireframes depict every single screen. Each screen may have many versions. Each version shows how each UI element could appear to the user. Complete wireframes are arranged to show user flows. Wireframes do not need to be perfect. They just need to be good enough to demonstrate what you want to build and how it should work. Everything in this gif could be considered a wireframe up until the gif changes to the finished 3D animation in color: [https://i.imgur.com/c4mIsif.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/c4mIsif.gifv) . As you progress through the process the wireframes will slowly become closer to what the finished product will look like.

**User flow**

* This refers to the path a person can take while using your product. It is a step by step map that follows a specific process. A user flow may show each step of first loading up your application, show them register an account, and end with them landing on the dashboard screen. It may continue on to show them use your application to get the benefit you promised them. It may only show the process of trying to create a password, getting an error, and trying to make a new password correctly.

**User story**

* The user story tells the story of who a particular user/customer is, why they are searching for the benefit you are offering them, and why they would accept your offer. It could be a summary of who they are in regards to their demographic and psychographic profile. It could be very detailed and include a lot of contextual data behind every aspect of that profile, going a few levels deep.","Do Not Solicit PM Requests ||| No direct sales, advertisements, or promotion",spam,False

All four loops including their heat exchangers and pumps are constructed of SUS316Ti, a standard stainless steel. This largely eliminates galvanic corrosion. Most molten salt designs envision using a low chromium, high nickel specialty steel called Alloy N for the surfaces contacting the fluoride salts. But after the MSRE, ORNL did a series of experiments with stainless steel and fluorides salts. Some of these tests ran for 45,000 hours (5 plus years). The tests showed that, provided the salt was free of impurities and maintained in a reducing condition, the effective SUS316 corrosion rate was about 0.025 mm/year.15 In other words, an extra 1 mm thickess is worth about 40 years. SUS316 is much more radiation resistant than high nickel alloys.

""corrosion attack on HASTELLOY® N alloy in molten fluoride salts at temperatures up to 1300°F (704°C), **was less than one mil per year""**

Please note:

A mil is a measurement that equals one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 inch. One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter). Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter. The term ""mil"" is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.

SUMMARY

As a result of these studies, we have found that Hastelloy N exposed
in salt containing metal tellurides such as Li Te and Cr Te undergoes
grain boundary embrittlement like that observed in the MSRE. The
embrittlement is a function of the chemical activity of tellurium
associated with the telluride. The degree of embrittlement can be
reduced by alloying additions to the Hastelloy N. The addition of 1 to
2 at. % Nb significantly reduces embrittlement


...


We have found that if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in fuel salt is kept
below about 60, embrittlement is essentially prevented when CrTel.266
is used as the source of tellurium.

Our findings suggest very strongly that a molten-salt reactor could be constructed of 1 - to 2%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N and operated very satisfactorily at 650°C.

Newer designs are much more efficient.\n\nFor example, an [Integral Fast Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor) pairs a standard Uranium-reactor with a breeder reactor. Breeder reactors can run on the waste of standard reactors, and even ""recycle"" it into more fuel for the standard reactor. The whole thing creates a highly-efficient closed-loop where very nearly ALL the fuel is consumed.

So in terms of total toxic material, even if none of it is recycled AND all of the metal was toxic, we'd be talking about 760,000 tons.

U-238 and Th-232 can be transmuted in a high neutron flux, which is present in a reactor, to Pu-239 and U-233. Pu-239 and U-233 are fissile (usable as a fuel). Natural Uranium is mostly U-238. So it is possible to extract fissile things that were in the fuel that have been transmuted.  

  

Additionally, not all of the fissile U-235 can be used in a reactor. Eventually, there would be so little fuel that you would not be able to attain criticality - the fuel would be unable to produce enough neutrons to continue the chain reaction. So you can extract some fissile material that was originally there anyway. This could easily amount to half of the U-235 that you put in there, which is substantial.  

  

What you **can not** use as fuel is fission products. When a fissile nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two daughter nuclei which have binding energies per nucleon close to the maximum. This means it is thermodynamically unfeasible to extract any more energy from the fission products. They will produce decay heat, but not enough to be useful.  See the graph of binding energy per nucleon:  [https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/21469-new-vogtle-nuclear-reactors-in-georgia-are-on-target-for-2021-2022-opening/](https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/21469-new-vogtle-nuclear-reactors-in-georgia-are-on-target-for-2021-2022-opening/)

Killing player demons used to cause 3 second lag spikes where nothing would happen and then either the slayer would instantly die or the second demon would die, firing BFG would cause an indefinite pause in all movement and a waiting for server until the BFG projectile hits the ground or a demon uses loot block, but its a lot less bad now.

f84k0ci,EngineeringStudents,['Re-admission into the College of Engineering (ME)Advice'],"Hey sorry for the late reply...

First off, thank you for reaching out and caring enough to ask about my situation. It's been a stressful year and 3 months but i'm not putting myself down because it has been some of the most productive time in my 22 years on earth. I've accomplished so much during my time away from my university and have been able to document and speak to every aspect of it.

I haven't submitted my petition yet as my adviser told me to wait until I was enrolled in the thermodynamics class at another university. I'm working on finalizing my materials to submit for my petition for March 1st. Obviously I won't have my final thermo grade in by then but i'm going to mention the grades I've gotten up-to March 1st(exam and quiz grades) 

From what I've heard talking to faculty and advisers, my chances for this appeal to go well ""seem"" to be overwhelmingly good. My adviser said that she doesn't often mention if a student has good odds, but for my case, she said it would be hard for the committee to ignore the type of student I have evolved into and how much more driven I will be this time around. 

Since  I got the letter from the academic standing committee after fall 2018 saying I won't be able to pursue ME at this time, there hasn't been a day where I haven't dreamed of finishing off my degree. It's been my motivator through all of this and has helped me create all my documents in my support. This has been a rude awakening for me and has been the most grueling lesson that I can only learn from. 

 I will be submitting this with my most sincere intentions but will be prepared to expect the worst news; in which case would mean all of my work for this degree gone.",No trolling or personal attacks,"harassment,trolling",False

In this example, each stack of LEGOs is the genome of a virus, and the two genomes swap a fragment. The genomes are still complete (there’s 7 LEGOs in each stack), but the stacks are now a bit different. However, this swapping essentially only occurs between related viruses. Fortunately for us, viruses can’t just swap genetic material with any other virus they encounter. SARS-CoV-2 will most likely only ever recombine with other betacoronaviruses (not measles, Ebola, or HIV).\n\nC - recombination doesn’t happen every time a host cell gets infected with two related viruses, but viral replication occurs at such a massive scale that eventually recombination can occur. A 1 in a million chance comes relatively often when there’s a trillion opportunities. Recombination occurs pretty readily in influenza, so it’s not like it’s an unheard of phenomenon.\n\nRecombination can, however, greatly affect how a virus behaves. In this article, the authors hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-2 is descended from a virus that resulted from a recombination event between a bat coronavirus and a pangolin coronavirus. In this instance, it looks like the bat coronavirus spike protein (the protein used by the virus to enter host cells) couldn’t bind to human cells but the pangolin spike protein could. When the recombination occurred, the bat coronavirus swapped its spike protein gene for the spike protein gene of the pangolin coronavirus. The resultant virus then gained the ability to enter human cells.', 'LEGO analogy just kinda blew my mind. Thanks for simplifying that in such an easily understandable way.', '[deleted]', ""Everything involved is totally chance. A virus is a bag of genes that, when it enters a host cell, causes that host cell to interpret it as instructions to make more virus. There is nothing there that could 'choose'.""]","Random, but with millions of animals getting the flu a 1 in a million event is almost inevitable.",Rule 10: No Low Effort Posts/Comments,content,False

I hate to make another comparison because they're so different, but this is one of the few ways it's comparable to the flu. Most people will have a minor infection, a few people will die. Same with the group of viruses that cause the common cold: in college I'd sometimes be bedridden for a week by the big cold while my roommate would be gross for a day or two.\n\nThe question I've seen asked about SARS-CoV-2 is whether an increased viral load will increase the severity of infection.

But probably less likely than if you were not vaccinated to begin with. It all depends on various measures of the actual vaccine’s efficacy.

However, they do [tell you](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) that catching the flu but having a mild case is one of the likely outcomes of getting the flu vaccine. So some Covid vaccines may do the same to some people.

Do note that the scenario of an asymptomatic Typhoid Mary-type super spreader in Covid is scare-mongering. The available epidemiology/modeling papers suggest that people who *never* develop symptoms account for a very small percentage of transmission. People who are about to get sick in the next couple of days (pre-symptomatic) are important spreaders.

Turkey declared 12 miles in the Black Sea because Turkey shared black sea with Warsaw pact countries proportionally and fairly in the 80’s. So there is nothing wrong with that. Noone claims otherwise or feel threatened but when we come Aegean its a sea with disputes and aim of Greece to make it 12 nm just for blocking Turkeys free access to Sea. You may say its the international law why Greece would try that. Turkey accepted to give islands to give Greece under two condition. First one is The Islands is Greek but Sea, Underwater sources etc. is Turkish. Second one is that Island should be demilitarized. So if Greece does what it tries to do by abusing EU and NATO there wouldnt be any reason for Turkey not claim and invade islands. So thats why pushing 12 nautical miles in the sea like Aegean nothing but attempt to change status quo but you cant change something like this with games.

Lets answer your question.  \n\nThank you. I welcome cordial dialogue. :)\n\nTo clarify, I didn't say there is anything wrong with Turkey extending to 12 nm, I was attempting to make a correlation and just addressing the logic considering the map and painting Greece as seeking 'expansionism' when we are just demanding the same territorial waters and airspace that 99% of the world uses in the same situations. Just like Turkey has the right to extend to 12nm elsewhere, and just like every other country in the world (except 2) Greece should have that right as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> First one is Islands is Greek but Sea, Underwater sources etc. is Turkish. \n\nWhat treaty are you referencing that designated the water and continental shelf to Turkey? I have read the  1923 Treaty of Lausanne and 1947 Paris Peace Treaty and have never seen such declarations. Do share your sources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Second is Island should be demilitarized.  \n\n1936 Montreux Convention on the Turkish Straits allowed for a militarization of the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, which Greeks argue is a breach of the Treaty of Lausanne which initially ordered for its demilitarization just as with the Aegean islands. Turkey has militarized Anatolian coastal areas (as permitted) in close proximity to Greek islands and Greece feels it is within our rights to protect our islands. and our people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Greece does what it tries to do by abusing EU and NATO there wouldnt be any reason for Turkey not claim and invade islands. So thats why pushing 12 nautical miles in the sea like Aegean nothing but attempt to change status quo but you cant change something like this with Games. Only thing you can change it by war thats why there is Casus Belli. That literally means from Turkish side if you dont respect the treaties and conditions there is no reason for those islands to stay Greek. \n\nThere is no reason those islands to stay Greek? This is where we get a big jump in dialogue. We're discussing what is legal or right, and suddenly you're talking of invading Greek islands.\n\nThe thread accuses Greece of being expansionists but it is Turkey that threatens to invade Greek land (you're not the first reference to it in here). Turkey wants more water and the rights to areas surrounding Greek islands, that gives Turkey the right to just take them? How is that ok? How is that good neighborly relations? This is exactly why Greece has militarized the Aegean islands, because of a constant threat of war. The only time you hear a Greek speak of invasion is in a manor of a troll and it isn't appropriate, those types of statements don't help anybody. Greek politicians and military leaders never reference invading islands or mainland that belongs to Turkey. On the contrary Erdogan and Turkish leaders do make those types of comments.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  So thats why pushing 12 nautical miles in the sea like Aegean nothing but attempt to change status quo but you cant change something like this with Games. \n\nWell, likewise Turkey cannot start researching and drilling in waters that have not been defined by Turkey and Greece through a treaty or agreement.

The Turkish government reiterated this position when then-Turkish Foreign Minister Rustu Aras, in his address to the Turkish National Assembly on the occasion of the ratification of the Montreux Treaty, unreservedly recognised Greece’s legal right to deploy troops on Lemnos and Samothrace, with the following statement: “The provisions pertaining to the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace, which belong to our neighbour and friendly country Greece and were demilitarised in application of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, were also abolished by the new Montreux Treaty, which gives us great pleasure” (Gazette of the Minutes of the Turkish National Assembly, volume 12, July 31/1936, page 309). During the same period, Turkey gave similar assurances on this subject to the governments of interested third countries.*\n\n*Lesvos, Chios, Samos and Ikaria.*\n\n*The Lausanne Treaty makes no mention of these islands having been granted demilitarised status.*\n\n*The Greek government simply commits to not establishing naval bases or fortifications there in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty. More specifically, this article specifies that:*\n\n*“With a view to ensuring the maintenance of peace, the Greek Government undertakes to observe the following restrictions in the islands of Mytilene, Chios, Samos and Nikaria:*\n\n*- No naval base and no fortification will be established in the said islands*\n\n*- Greek military aircraft will be forbidden to fly over the territory of the Anatolian coast. Reciprocally, the Turkish Government will forbid their military aircraft to fly over the said islands*\n\n*- The Greek military forces in the said islands will be limited to the normal contingent called up for military service, which can be trained on the spot, as well as to a force of gendarmerie and police in proportion to the force of gendarmerie and police existing in the whole of the Greek territory”*\n\n*Whilst to date Greece has faithfully implemented these provisions, Turkey has repeatedly violated the legal obligations incumbent upon it and continues to do so, despite the fact that the same article obliges Turkey not to permit its military aircraft to enter the airspace of these Greek islands.*\n\n*Dodecanese*\n\n*The Dodecanese (Astypalea, Rhodes, Halki, Karpathos, Kassos, Tilos, Nisyros, Kalymnos, Leros, Patmos, Lipsi, Symi, Kos and Kastelorizo, as well as the islets adjacent to them) were ceded to Greece “under full sovereignty” Paris Peace of 1947 between Italy and the Allies.*\n\n*Provisions of this Treaty provided for the demilitarisation of these islands: “The above islands shall be demilitarised and shall remain so.” There is a National Guard presence on the Dodecanese islands, which has been declared in accordance with CFE provisions.*\n\n*Turkish claims on the demilitarisation of the Dodecanese islands, it should be noted that:*\n\n*- Turkey is not a signatory state to this Treaty, which therefore constitutes a “res inter alios acta” for Turkey; i.e., an issue pertaining to others. According to Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a treaty does not create obligations or rights for third countries.*\n\n*- The demilitarised status of the Dodecanese islands was imposed after the decisive intervention of the Soviet Union and echoes Moscow’s political intentions at that point in time. It should be noted, that demilitarised status lost its raison d’être with the creation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as incompatible with countries’ participation in military alliances. Against this backdrop, demilitarised status ceased to apply to the Italian islands of Pantelaria, Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa, as well as to West Germany on the one hand and Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, Hungary and Finland on the other.*\n\n*It should be stressed that Greece, just like any other country in the world, has never ceded its natural right of defence in the event of a threat to its islands or any other part of its territory, especially since there has been sufficient proof over the past decades that Turkey is acting in an inconsistent manner and in violation of the UN Charter.*\n\n*Article 34 of the Treaty of Vienna on the Law of Treaties: “A treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”\xa0 Turkey is not a party to the Paris Peace Treaty and therefore “has no right to speak.”*\n\n*In addition to those provided by the international treaties of Lausanne, Montreux and Paris for these Greek islands, the basic principle and crown of all is Article 51 of the Charter of the UN, which refers to actions in relation to threats to peace, violations. peace and aggression:*\n\n*Greece cannot reason relinquish its natural and legal right to defend itself in the event of a threat against its islands, at a time when Turkey has already threatened Greece with a Casus Belli, has aggressively ordered its forces on coastal areas of Turkey near the islands to regularly conduct landing exercises, has concentrated landings in areas opposite the islands, and violates Greek daily airspace in the area with armed aircraft.*\n\n\\---------------------\n\n<Response Part 2>""]",">You said you dont want to be rude. But you be. You are heavily biased and i think you should return your crusader club In r/ europe .

What have I said that was rude? I'm having a discussion and stating my opinion. I've been polite. I didn't resort to name calling or anything mean. I called out that war and taking over Greek islands isn't an acceptable conclusion. But I never crossed any lines, I just stated my opinions. I try to be cautious with my words, I'm sorry that you feel that I was rude. Moving on...

>Also Turkey has all rigths to do everything on its own eez. And warships protecting state asset. Because there is a threat to it. And also eez isnt terretorial waters. Any country can have battle ships at any sea as long as it international water. So having a ship in a sea isnt a offensive act. All navies ships swimming all around the world for gods sake. US ships are all around the ocean and you are saying its offensive to Turkey have battleships to protect its asset in its own eez Which is right beside its mainland.

In my initial reply to u/cangs95 I said *""Well, likewise Turkey cannot start researching and drilling in waters that have not been defined by Turkey and Greece through a treaty or agreement. Sending research vessels escorted by navy are 'games' that go against international laws and good neighborly relations. This is an escalation that will not help with negotiations.""*

So let me clarify what I mean. First it is important to understand that until a treaty or agreement is signed and ratified between two nations, an EEZ is not theirs if it is 'disputed waters.' The tricky thing about 'disputed waters' is most of the world views that both countries can make a claim towards an area but until it is agreed upon neither should act in those waters. Issuing a Navtex for a military exercise is very different than issuing a Navtex to research and drill in waters that haven't been agreed upon.

So, your reference regarding US naval ships around the world, you are correct. Most of the countries that participated in the UN Convention on the Laws Of the Sea agreed with the view that nations are permitted to military operations or exercises with the EEZ of another nation. In this case, when Turkey issued it's Navtex it was not just for military exercises, it also included the research for hydrocarbons which is not permitted for another nation to do in 'disputed waters.' Greece has never restricted military exercises in Greek claimed EEZ. The US doesn't go and research for hydrocarbons in another nation's EEZ, their military sails through it or spends some time there. It is not the same thing as national commercial benefit from the 'disputed' areas. It needs to be resolved diplomatically or through the international courts. Then, a treaty could be made based on that verdict. Or, it could lead to a conflict/skirmish anyways because both parties won't relent on what they have a claim to.

Even countries that tend to see the Turkish perspective or understand the reason for needing to find a mutually beneficial solution regarding the effects from Kastellorizo, they don't tend to agree with Turkey on the Aegean and the EEZ near the Dodecanese and Crete. The treaty with the GNA government of Libya has received condemnation from the international community. It negotiated EEZ that is claimed by a third party, Greece, dividing up Greek EEZ among themselves. That not going to stand in international courts without Greece's approval. Turkey first needed to come to an agreement on where their EEZ borders meet by Crete and the Dodecanese and the role of Kastellorizo, then if that treaty or agreement is made and somehow Greece gave up their border to Libya and Egypt could Turkey act on it with a treaty or agreement with those nations. Greece countered that treaty with the Greek - Egyptian maritime agreement. Greece did it after Turkey, to counter the claim to those waters. It won't uphold, just like with the Turkey - Libya deal, unless Turkey and Greece come to an agreement. Turkey does not have the right to do whatever it wants in those waters because it has not been solidified between both parties. This is why Greece had never issued a Navtex for the research of hydrocarbons in those waters before.

It doesn\'t strike me as any different than flinging a billiard ball at someone.\n\nIf *catapult* can deal 3d8 when it\'s thrown 90 feet, then surely this can deal 1d8 for 60?\n\nAll in all, I personally disagree with your takes, but they\'re not necessarily invalid.

It's no secret men and women have, in general, different social support to fall back on to, be it a stable and supportive group of friends, available public support groups, shelters and whatnot. In these matters, men are at a disadvantage.   
It seems very plausible to me that this feeds into more men having no tangible way out of terrible situations, feeling left behind and alone to a point where they turn to crime. 'The whole world is against me, so now it's me against the world'.

I don't know where you were looking, but you might have misinterpreted numbers. Last year the reported ""crimes against the person"" (includes property crimes) victimization rate for men was 14% higher than for women. For violent crime the men were 50% more likely to be victims, and men constituted more than 60 of murder victims see here: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/women-and-the-criminal-justice-system-2019/women-and-the-criminal-justice-system-2019

I do think there is a big problem with these statistics since ""what is a crime"" is a social construct, and there is no reason to think that social construct wouldn't already be sexist. Moreover, even in theory it was gender neutral, who reports is not.

Only 20 percent of the electricity produced here is from fossil fuel and most of that is in specific provinces like Alberta.  BC, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec all have low emission grids.   So an EV charged in much of Canada will have a much smaller operational footprint then a comparable gas car.   So if we say that the average car has a life to 300,000 kms and it will get 8L per 100 kms then it will use 24,000 liters of fuel to drive that distance.   That is 156,000 pounds of CO2 (5.1 pounds per liter burned and 1.4 pounds per liter to extract, transport and refine oil into gas).   An EV with an efficiency of 6 kms per kWh, that is charged on a grid that averages 30 grams of CO2 per kWh and driven the same distance over it's lifetime will produce 3307 pounds of CO2.   So the EV will produce 152,693 pounds or 76.35 tons of CO2 less.   So the 5000 dollar incentive, if only for CO2 reduction, would mean you are paying $65 per ton which is not massively out from what the true cost of carbon is per ton.   Also when you consider the other added benefits of a EV, cleaner air from not producing all the other things that a ICE emits for example, then the cost isn't really all the high at all.   
The problem is when most economists look at programs like this they are looking at grids that are much more dirty.  In the US for example the incentive is much harder to justify because the overall CO2 being released will be much higher since on average their grid is going to release much more CO2 then those in Canada.

I suspect is has to do with the cost of raising a child. Possibly the government should focus more heavily here.\n\nthere are dozens of reasons Canada relies on immigration to keep the economy chugging along at a growing rate - one of which is the cost of raising a child but also only one of many. Really, you could pick any of the following off the list to argue why we need immigration to keep the economy growing (key word growing)\n\n* citizens are no longer working low-skilled jobs ( labourer, custodian, fruit picker, etc) or ""high"" skilled jobs that are of poor pay or little educational requirements - mainly those in the service sector (retail or food). This likely a result of having:\n\n* a highly educated generation of middle aged citizens (25 - 40) who actively seek post-secondary education, high wage jobs, and positions in sectors that require high skill and a high level of education (engineers, public service, health, police, etc). Which results in them being overqualified for the work mentioned above\n\n* in tandem with this, as we become more educated, we are likely to have less kids. So instead of having 2-3 kids, people are electing to have 1 kid or none, or, pushing it off into the future for other life style choices (career, staying single, travelling, education). This results in us not meeting the replacement rate as people retire and die - that\'s not good for a growing economy\n\n* culture also plays an impact. Western developed nations very much focus on the individual and their options to do as they choose - cultures where we get our immigrants are usually more focused on a tight knit family, they stay close, care for one another, and have lots of kids. It is the collective over the individual - family first. If we bring in people and families with this mindset then it will help bring that replacement rate up that I mentioned\n\n* if we don\'t do the above, then it will create a huge economic issue as boomers retire. If we don\'t replace retirees (or work them to death) then that\'s less future taxpayers to pay for their retirement, their healthcare (old folks immune systems are not what they used to be) and their social services (retirement homes or public transport for example). It would create an incredible amount of financial stress to the our current generation moving forward, more than we are feeling now. And what we are feeling now is the inability to purchase homes, settle and have a family or save for retirement - which would be magnified even further if we didn\'t have anyone around to help us pay for any future costs. \n\n* lastly, tying into my first point,  immigration is essentially being used as a stop gap in lots parts for jobs that will become scarce and outdated (service sectors, manual labour, manufacturing) due to our lovely friend automation. Immigrants help us transition from a society with some automation to a society where automation is present everywhere (think self checkouts at Sobey\'s or McDonald\'s). Citizens usually can\'t make a career off those jobs rights now but immigrants can fill in the gaps until no one can make a career or even work them at all. \n\nThat\'s most of what I could think of off the top of my head - of course there are likely many more reasons as well', ""> lastly, tying into my first point, immigration is essentially being used as a stop gap in lots parts for jobs that will become scarce and outdated (service sectors, manual labour, manufacturing) due to our lovely friend automation.

My bet is that they are expecting recent immigrants to integrate and become the next generation of Canadians who enter the high skilled and highly educated workforce but, after that, then it becomes the question of how many of the jobs are going to be available to go around? And, how long till automation takes over *those* jobs? Not only that, that is assuming immigrants will want to continue coming here in the future and that their home nations will stagnate or become worse when it could be that their other nation\'s standards of living increase but there are various variables to consider there as well\n\nI assume some sort of UBI could be an answer to automation? But that is a lot to ask from our govt at the moment and is a contentious issue in itself. \n\nMy guess is that they don\'t really have a contingency plan that will alleviate this going forward and right now this is the ""short-term"" solution. Eventually, another government of ours in the future will come up with another short-term plan to solve it but we will just be back to square one.

I am in favour of minimum wage laws, but that's not the conversation we are having really. The conversation is ""We can't allow foreign workers to come and take Canadian jobs"" but if the job only really exists because of foreign workers, then that is a factitious argument.

Most minimum wage jobs can survive an increase in compensation. Most farm jobs cannot survive an increase in compensation to the point that Canadian workers would actually be attracted to them in sufficient number to fill needs.

If someone pulls a machete back into a striking position it's time to run or at least back the fuck up five paces.

I see this exact same thing happening a lot in videos although usually it's a punch that is thrown not a machete to the neck: you see someone pull back their fist to strike when they're nose to nose and the other person keeps his arms at his sides and doesn't back up at all, leaving himself totally exposed to being hit. 

The intention might be to not show any cowardice but it absolutely leaves the person vulnerable and exposed.

The first thing you do if someone raises a stick or a knife or a fist is you back the fuck up and run if necessary. At the very least raise both hands in front of your face in an open palm showing no threatening intent but allowing you to block something if it comes.

The mother who was a single parent was supportive but careful. Ultimately children are still children--no kid should allowed to make life altering changes to themselves while their mind and body is still growing. This parent had their child see a therapist that specialized in transgender children, had the support of counselors and the school staff, but the mother would not allow the start of transitioning until her kid was a legal adult. Saul, as he began to call himself, eventually decided against a full transition when he became a legal adult, though he had been so adamant about it in his youth. He still lives as a man went on to take medication to assist with his appearance, but his physical form, even in his youth, was rather masculine.

Parents who do allow their children to make permanent changes to their body at such a young age are irresponsible, neglecting their parental responsibility of keeping their child safe. This is why a *psychologist*, *the courts*, along with parents and doctor, should be involved in the discussion of a child transitioning. There's a well cited study, while singular in nature, has been hawked as proof that transition regret is extremely low. However, I don't see between 9% and 11% as low. Neither is the over 60% who detransition for a time. These were all adults that were surveyed. What must the numbers be like for children?

I think the people who advocate young transitions come from a (mostly) good, but reckless, place. They mean well and are eager to champion (what they see as) a marginalized group, but in their zeal, they choose to endanger the lives and mental health of children for the sake of a ""cause"". They act as if acknowledging transition regret will hurt transgenders as a whole, instead of looking at the why and how that could possibly be amended. One can still be for transgender rights and want to tackle the issue of transition regret. One can still support the transgender people in their lives and still advocate for transitions to occur as legal adults. So many people get stuck in political extremes of the issue instead of a taking a responsible, common sense, non-political  approach. What's most troubling is that the bulk of people who advocate for young kids to make the choice to transition are often straight people--it sends a strange and mixed message.","Be Civil: No name calling, no sexist, racist, ...","hatespeech,incivility",False

Do they send it to you for free when someone purchases your item?', ""How much time does it usually take you? And do you do it within your city or do you send them out across the country?\n\nI've been wanting to get into it for a while but I find that I am really intimidated by the idea that someone would want to pay shipping!"", ""Unfortunately they don't send it to you, you will have to provide that yourself. So there's two ways you can do this (and a third I have no experience with so I can't recommend it but will mention it.) You could save boxes/mailers from your own orders (I get pretty much everything online other than food - especially since covid - so I have a good supply of mailing supplies that way.) You could also just figure out the amount of packaging materials you will need and the amount they will cost and include that in the price you will be selling the item for. The third one I've never tried so not sure how it would work is a lot of stores will give you boxes for free if you ask since they just break it down and throw it away anyways (if you work in retail or in any kind of place where you have access to the incoming mail you could just get it from there.) The good thing about clothes is they don't require a lot of packing materials. I know etsy has a lot of shops that specifically deal with selling packing materials for pretty cheap: [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/shipitsupply) is one I use sometimes when I run out of mine. There's not much you need other than bubble mailers and tape to be honest.\nedit: forgot to mention, USPS first class boxes that you can get for free from the post office cannot be used. I know for sure mercari doesn't allow it, and I think poshmark doesn't either, though I haven't used poshmark enough to be 100% sure."", 'Thanks for the comprehensive response!', 'For Poshmark, you use free USPS Priority mail boxes to ship out: [https://poshmark.com/posh\\_guide/how\\_to\\_ship](https://poshmark.com/posh_guide/how_to_ship) because all Poshmark shipping is USPS Priority Mail. You can get these boxes for free at USPS: [https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm](https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm) (see Free boxes list on this page, you order what sizes you need, and USPS mail them to you for free). For Mercari, there are several options to shipping (USPS, UPS, Fedex, etc), so you choose what option you want (can be optimal to how expensive shipping is based on the item weight/size), so you provide your own boxes.', 'This is not 100% true and depends on the shipping method you are using. For Poshmark, all shipping is done thru USPS priority mail, which you can use the free USPS priority mail boxes. For Mercari, you might not be able to use the free USPS priority boxes because you have the option to choose what shipping method you want (opportunistically).', ""The biggest time suck is taking photos and writing descriptions. Using the resell sites or subreddits like r/wardrobepurge makes its alot easier. I'd say that Poshmark is the easiest to quickly upload photos and write descriptions that can reach a wide audience, but has a culture or re-sharing to reach your audience. Mercari is also easy to use, and has a set and forget it type of mentality. Note that all re-selling sites take a cut, with Poshmark being the most at about 20%, but Poshmark handles all shipping (you literally put your item in a free box and print out the shipping label they email you), so it can be the easiest to start with.\n\nI'd say if you're willing to give it a shot, dedicate one day to identify all the things you want to sell, then take clear photos of them, and see how far you get. Once you take the photos and upload them to a re-selling site, there's not too much of a time sink. Also, once you take photos and make descriptions for one site, it can be easier to put it on multiple reselling sites (you've already created the content). It does take time and patience though for things to sell, so if you are someone who hates having a pile of items sitting at your home, it might not be the best method for you. Overall, its not a non-zero effort, but it can be minimal-medium amount of effort."", ""So my main platform is mercari and it's kind of the whole country on there. So I send packages out for all over the place. It does sound very intimidating for sure but honestly it's a lot easier than it looks like. I've been selling for about 2-3 years, and I only sell things I do not need anymore, so it's not my job nor do I go out of my way to acquire things for selling.  That being said, mercari does provide you with a pretty good way to create your shipping labels so you don't have to worry about it. For the most part you just have to weigh the item and it will tell you how much shipping is going to be (do not try to put in lower weight to get cheaper shipping, they will catch it eventually and it's not worth it). You can choose to offer free shipping so that you will be paying for it instead of your buyer but I honestly wouldn't recommend it because people will not consider this factor and will try to be very cheap with you. But it's up to you. And people are willing to pay for shipping so I wouldn't worry about it (I do buy there sometimes as well and I don't mind paying shipping, prices are already pretty low anyways.) After you got all that and somebody buys your item, mercari will create a label for you that you just have to print and slap on the package. As for time, I only ever have 10-20 items listed at a time because it's easier to manage, and I don't have to spend all my time on them. Generally it doesn't take long even if you take your time with them, and once you know what you are doing it will be even faster. Depending on the item, I only spend about 10-20 minutes on one (including taking pictures, writing the description, researching prices.) So if you feel like it's worth the time for you and the effort, I would definitely jump into it, you will learn as you go and it's kind of fun interacting with other people about your items (not all the time but most of my experiences have been good so far.) Another tip for heavier items: poshmark has better shipping prices for heavier items like coats and shoes so I would crosslist those between mercari and poshmark."", ""As I said, I wasn't sure about poshmark.

If someone is having a specific issue or a hard time, they should vent/discuss/get advice, but constantly repeating ""this sucks"" is not beneficial.  My life got immeasurably better when I started focusing on what I CAN do!\n\nSo.....I\'ve written and deleted what my powers are but it sounds pretentious and egotistical so I keep deleting it.  Haha.  My specifics are irrelevant anyway.  We\'re all different.\n\nLook at it this way:  A blind person may have an advantage with their hearing.  *Because* of their blindness.  Look at your deficiencies, and then see what you\'ve gained in their place.', 'Because we are disempowered by society. Many of us are fucking amazing and need to discover it.', 'I think it\'s a bit more complex than that. \n\nI can choose to lie to someone or not to lie someone. One of the positive aspects of my autism is that I can focus completely and with passion for my interests for extended periods, and be brutally honest with myself and others *when it is polite* (or otherwise necessary). For example, I\'m an electrical engineering major, and not only would I identify as ""interested in my major,"" but I also care about the fate of the industry and I want to contribute to the latest theories, such as fully fleshing out multivariable linear systems theory and developing techniques to analyze nonlinear systems, as well as the history, both professional and personal, of physicists and engineers who contributed to the field. I don\'t know *anyone* in my college with that level of interest, except a few professors. (A lot of people go into engineering fields because they\'re ""good at math"" and want a high paying job, so there are absolutely a,lot of people there who are bored out of their skulls.) But I don\'t *always* have to act like that. \n\nAnd while I absolutely do not want to live exactly as NTs live (sorry), I would like to have the option to choose, in certain situations, to not be perceived as anything interesting. E.g., if I\'m at the DMV, I want to be one of the other hundreds of replaceable nobodies, not the character who\'s existence terrorizes the staff and will eventually be the guy getting manhandled by bored security giddy for a chance to escalate the situation. For that to work, I need to lie, fake it, and keep my mouth shut until what is considered acceptable behavior is widened to include various autistic behaviors. \n\nWhat I will say is that we should minimize masking. It is physically and mentally exhausting; I\'m recovering from a straight year of it in college and being stuck at home with the family. Last week, I was aggressively questioned by a police officer who thought I was stealing license plates (I wasn\'t, and I don\'t do janky shit). The mask fell apart because he just kept taunting me and escalating the situation, and that is a summary of almost every interaction I\'ve ever had with a police officer. (I\'m from the US, white guy; I don\'t have any anti or pro-police stickers on my car or elsewhere, or any stickers, and I stay polite and cordial with hands on the wheel). I mask to avoid these exact scenarios with more reasonable people who aren\'t human bulldogs; without them, I would be locking myself out of many of many opportunities in society, like (at least for my set of idiosyncrasies) anything involving bureaucracy (e.g., going to the DMV, City Hall, bank (in person), doing taxes, voting) collaboration, and gatekeepers (e.g., college, professional organizations). But like I said, it is exhausting and should be kept to a bare minimum. I still want to be as honest and exact as is polite, and if I\'m feeling confident I\'ll push towards more exact. \n\nThis got kinda long, but my overarching point is that I\'m not giving up anything by learning to lie for NT people. I\'m still very much my autistic self with my special interests and brutal honesty for people who are willing to listen. I\'m not particularly envious of the NT lifestyle, but in my view, if you don\'t make any concessions to their way, you will be treated as a second class citizen. I\'m not sure if I\'ve said it explicitly, but I don\'t think that this *should* be the case, merely that it *is.* In fact, it should be the opposite- it should be polite to exhibit NT or autistic, and neither should make a person an n-th class citizen (not that we ought to have classes either, but that\'s a discussion for another day) .']","I think masking, lying, and being low-key are 3 entirely separate things.",Be Respectful,incivility,False

Are you a nerd / geek? If so I suggest science fiction conventions, and finding the most socially awkward desperate girls you can find and maybe one of them will go for you.

If you\'re under 35, it might not be too late for you.\n\nI know it seems impossible and I still don\'t know how the hell I managed it myself but I was desperate enough to try anyway and roll those damned dice over and over and over until I finally hit that ridiculously tiny target number. I hit the rock bottom point where I was willing to get rejected a hundred times in a night if it it meant rolling one more time for that chance at that coveted nat 00 (100). When I met the love of my life was the last hour of the last day of a convention after several others that I tried and failed at previously. The odds were ridiculously low but I rolled the dice often enough I got stupid fucking lucky. Again, desperation can drive ridiculous levels of ""fuck the odds"" effort and that\'s the only thing that got me through it. Maybe you can find that desperate courage as well.\n\nAfter her, I managed to get into a few more relationships but none ever worked right and all failed within no more than a year or two tops. The last time I was so desperate I ignored every red flag under the sun and got myself into an abusive relationship with a woman who was only interested in using me for what little money I had and sucked me dry and cost me everything I owned and would have continued to suck on the dry blood-drained corpse if not for an argument due me weakly attempting to stand up for myself that she couldn\'t tolerate that led to her becoming furious to the point she threw me out of my own home. Vampires don\'t like their prey getting uppity. Then she tried to lure me back like the proverbial spider to the fly, but no matter how miserable and desperate I was I understood that I was better off dead than in that web again. From that I learned the lesson that sometimes even forever alone isn\'t the worst possible outcome, it can be worse in ways hard to imagine unless you\'ve lived it.\n\nSince then I\'ve mostly accepted that my life is over and has been over for quite a while and I just never allowed myself to face the fact. I keep myself distracted as best I can, set other goals for myself and stay busy with creative projects and online interactions that don\'t require going outside among other people. Part of me hopes that through some program of self-improvement I might reach a point where the target number falls within the outer ranges of what my dice can potentially roll, but I mostly let that part yammer on in the corner of my brain without paying its dumb ass much attention.

The tactics are so common from leaders and media that people habitually make the same type of argument.

This has been my experience as well.

But I think we need to look inward for the cause. People that see [politics as a sports to be won by their side](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/03/politics-liberal-democrat-conservative-republican/) will tolerate bad faith arguments. It's a self perpetuating cycle that deepens over time: my leader makes a bad argument that helps me win, so I support it without judgement. Then the leader sees the bad faith argument worked, and then raises the stakes for the next one. If I keep letting them get away with it, it gets worse and worse for all of us. This leads towards stifling honest discourse and replacing it with tribal bickering.

It's been going on for so long that now many people don't take the time to think about what they are doing, they argue in bad faith repeating the arguments they heard from their leaders, [they take tribal positions](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-new-report-offers-insights-into-tribalism-in-the-age-of-trump), and think this is the normal way to make an argument.

People need to stop and ask themselves if they want to be the informed and critical constituency that makes democracy work. Until we the individual voters deliberately choose to be right and do what's right, we are going to keep playing into the 2 party game show. In the end it doesn't matter which party is on top if we've debased politics to a sports competition, we are all constantly losing as a people.

Everyone at home, start with yourself. Do you hold your representatives accountable? Do you demand good faith arguments from your own people? How can you expect it from anyone else if you don't expect it from yourself.

[The US is obsessed with patriotism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201503/is-american-patriotism-getting-out-hand), so we should ingrain the definition better. This is the main difference between a real patriot and a cardboard patriot. The real one will demand truth and fairness, and hold everyone accountable including their own people. 

Wrapping yourself in flags is no substitute for demanding good faith discourse from our leaders. It's actually the opposite. Those wrapped in flags choosing to repeat the bad faith verbatim are the ones helping to hold our discourse hostage. 

I bring up the patriotism and the flag so people can see when they are [acting like sports tribalism](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2019/01/sports_fandom_study.html). You wear face paint and tribal colors to a sports game. When it comes to politics, when we are deciding the future of our communities and families, what you should bring is reasonable sense and good faith discourse. Nobody has all the answers, and we sure are not going to find collective answers to difficult topics by taking tribal sides.

I honestly thought her talking about not wanting to recommend the builder to 500k people was an attempt to get him to give her what she wants. 

I think Lauren is very sneaky and fake. She recommends anything for a buck and her content is so boring recently that she’s probably desperate for the stories she’ll have with design and organizing companies. I really don’t believe most things that come out of her mouth. They go to that house every day she knew there was still a lot to do.

How many people in shopping centres are you interacting with? Even for 5 mins? The answer would be zero. The checkouts have a barrier now. \n\nWhat about cinemas with high ceilings and they already have a distancing policy? \n\nI have no problem with the PT part of it. Close quarters for extended time. Same as a plane. \n\nThis is what media pressure has done to her. She is listening to the media. If she has like she said been considering for months about this, then she was thinking about it when we had zero cases for weeks. So she is lying or an idiot.""]","Shopping centres and cinemas, counterintuitively, are not high-risk. 

Pokies are a bit tricky as there are a few set up in confined spaces like old RSLs, and quite a lot in more spacious areas like Crown casino here in Melbourne. And people sit there for fucking hours, and those using them are often from the more vulnerable part of the population - older, obese, heavy drinkers and smokers, etc. Personally I'd take a cricket bat to all the pokies, but short of that in this case I'd mandate masks there, too. 

Public transport, it depends how crowded it is, but here in Melbourne with so many people working from home, last I heard it's overall at 30% of where it was before, so people aren't shoulder-to-shoulder, and with the doors opening at every stop, honestly I consider it not to be high-risk. On the other hand since people are just sitting there for 15-60' and it's airconditioned, mask-wearing isn't much of a burden. 

Not requiring it for offices makes no sense. Restaurants it's pretty much pointless as people will be unmasked for most of the time they're there anyway, and they'll be close to others. Personally if cases were a significant number (they're not) then I'd just be going for the outdoor restaurants, or very open ones - like those where the whole front opens up. I'd avoid the closed-door cosy romantic places. 

As you note, these decisions are never made purely based on public health advice, but are necessarily political. This causes some of them to do unnecessarily stringent things, as here in Victoria, and some dangerously loose things, as in large parts of the US. Not many have the courage to stick to the sensible middle ground.","Heated debate is acceptable, personal attacks ...",harassment,False

fiph2re,TrueChristian,"['""Is this a sin ...? Is that a sin ...?"" - not the right questions to ask', 'Jesus tells us in Matthew 7 that we will recognize false prophets from true ones by their fruit.  Whenever he talks about fruit, plants, etc., it\'s virtually always in the context of spiritual reproduction.  Matthew 12 is an obvious example because it\'s one of the few parables he directly explains.  He tells us that we are the soil, the seed is the Word of God planted in us - and that this seed, when mature, grows into a plant that will produce more seed yielding a crop 30, 60, or 100 times what was sown - that is: reproduction of the Gospel within us into nearby soil.  The ""fruit"" is the seed-bearing part of a plant that has the capacity for reproduction into the nearby soil.  This is also why in another parable Jesus says, ""Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.""  That is, it can\'t be horded by the original plant - it must be spread out nearby so that the plant won\'t be alone and other plants can grow from it.  This is what I believe Jesus means when he says, ""By their fruit you will recognize them.""\n\nNow, it\'s not surprising that Jesus would tie this to our ability to recognize who is a genuine prophet/teacher from a false one.  If a person is merely a critic, but does nothing to advance the Gospel, can you really trust him?  Or perhaps someone does preach the Gospel, but their preaching only raises up bitterness and dissention and does not actually help anyone learn to follow Jesus - can you trust such a man?  But if, instead, we see a man who not only follows the Word in his own life, but also has devoted his life to helping others learn to follow Jesus also, and spiritual generations are actually flowing from his life so that his crop is yielding the harvest 30, 60, or even 100 times what was sown - shouldn\'t we trust such a person?  This is the test that Jesus gives.\n\nInterestingly, he goes even deeper.  A subject on which people love to debate is the unforgivable sin.  What is it?  How do we know when we\'ve crossed that line?  I\'m shocked at the fact that everyone wants to quote Matthew 12:33 to reference it, but in explaining it I\'ve never yet met anyone who cited the very next verse, which says: ""Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.""  I\'m fascinated that the same test Jesus gives for false teachers is equally associated with the unforgivable sin - almost as if the unforgivable sin itself is the act of leading people away from Christ (i.e. reproducing death in others instead of life; bad fruit).\n\nI hope this helps.  This is the criterion I use to discern who is a false teacher from a true one.  To be clear: just because someone has a large congregation doesn\'t mean they have lots of fruit.  It\'s possible that many people are there not because of the pastor\'s reproduction, but because of the influence of the people in the crowd who invited them.  It\'s also possible that the pastor is preaching falsities and the people attending are not good fruit at all; rather, he is amassing bad fruit together.  So, don\'t assume, as some do, ""The larger the congregation, the more reliable the pastor.""  That would be a mistake (as is obviously the case with Joel Osteen and his congregation).  If anything, when we see a message that is mass-accepted, we ought to be skeptical because Jesus tells us (also in Matthew 7) that the road to heaven is narrow, but the road to hell is wide.  Look where the masses gather and let that be an indication (of many other factors, not on its own) of the reliability of the direction the road leads.\n\nAll of that aside, Acts 17 also commends the Bereans for being more noble than the Thessalonians.  Why?  Because they heard the apostles preaching and instead of accepting it on their word, they carefully examined the Scriptures to see for themselves if what was being taught was true or false.  **This is the best way to ascertain a true from false teacher: by testing what they say against your own review of Scripture.**  Now, some people will have reasonable disagreements of interpretation, which don\'t qualify someone as a false teacher.  But at some point it becomes obvious when someone is stretching the meaning of a passage to say what they want it to say rather than what it actually says.  Rick Warren is known for doing this.  One of his elders/staff members discipled me for a time and he commented on one of his greatest frustrations that Rick would look through dozens of translations of the Bible to find the one that most closely resembled the point he wanted to make in order to bolster his argument.  This is trying to force an interpretation into the text and it\'s dangerous.\n\nAnyway, I hope this is helpful.']",I can see the effort you put into this response and I want to thank you for being so helpful!,Be respectful,incivility,False

I am quite susceptible to placebo/nocebo effects, and I had a first hand experience with the impact that believing something is wrong can actually cause problems.

Things like motivation and anxiety are very easily affected by psychology, and they seem to be a strong driver behind why young guys who aren't even hypogonadal are jumping on TRT - people are anxious, depressed, and struggling to find a reason to live in this crazy world, and they hope that TRT can fix that.

Unfortunately for me and many other guys on here, we will remain anxious and depressed regardless of our hormones, because our hormones are not the root of the problem.

I want  to share with you guys how I see the world...its abit like this...

Revelations 🔴🔵 (perspective of the last adam)

Let me share with you my perspective;

1) [1) Lex Luthors Epiphany](https://youtu.be/A9vzZa8TsKM)

Everything and everyone is connected with the universe.

[2) Flying Eagle point of view](https://youtu.be/QwNc0SFIp-o)

I have soared through the clouds on eagle wings

[3) Pocahantas - Colours of the Wind](https://youtu.be/TkV-of_eN2w)

I have seen the wind dance and flow like a stream...

[4) Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g)

I have watch the earth from the moon
And observe earth from a distance...

[5) Beyond Earth](https://youtu.be/yEl9kI2Aluw)

We have so much more of the universe to explore

[6) Star Trek Inspirational Speeches](https://youtu.be/zNu1cdISsvY)

So much more adventures to help humanity to grow through experience. We are never going back to the ""original"" garden of eden... because it was in that condition (spoilt brat, selfish bully twat) that brought the fall of men...instead humanity will learn through adventures, and learning to understand anothers perspective and learning to work together and learning humility just as I humbled myself as man.

Similarly, if you use a VPN, everyone can see that you are using a VPN, but no one (except the VPN provider) can see what you're doing over the VPN connection.

Think of it as watching two people having a conversation by whispering in each other's ear. You can see that they're talking to each other, but you can't hear what they're talking about.

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, K nock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, And towards our distant rest began to trudge. Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, But someone still was yelling out and stumbling And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.— Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams before my helpless sight, He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace Behind the wagon that we flung him in, And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— My friend, you would not tell with such high zest To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie: *Dulce et decorum est* *Pro patria mori.*",[8] Not Relevant Content,off-topic,False

>If this situation has taught me anything, it's that the moral position of ""saving lives"" is relatively superficial. It's more about us and our ego than it is about the other real or hypothetical people we claim to do it for. To me, valuing the quality of life is the more mature and balanced position--I mean, if someone lives 100 useless or shitty years, what's the point? Is that really supposed to be superior than someone living only 25 years of giving love and enjoying life to the fullest? I think not. Valuing quality of life means you enjoy it while it's here, and have the strength to overcome the grief when people pass . . . instead of trying to keep them alive when it's their time to go. I'm not saying we can never try to delay death, but sometimes it's not worth it.

>In sum, I don't think it's worth it to keep people locked in their homes simply so we can say we saved them.

My own son faced death as an infant due to heart defects and we realized pretty quickly that prolonging life isn't the highest virtue, that there are things in life worse than death. 

What if we put him through all kinds of pain and isolation and had him hooked up to all kinds of machines in order to prolong his life for a few more weeks or months. After he passed away wouldn't we always regret that we didn't spend his last days with him in peace at home as a family? 

He's healthy and doing well, but we've made decisions for his care based on this thinking and we really did face situations where his death was a real possibility. 

At the time we were dealing with that I wrote in an email:

>In that situation the natural response is to be miserable, but you know what would be more miserable than watching my child pass away?

It's nice for both of us to express how we feel without being judge by the other.""]","I don't want to deny the pain you must feel around this, I'm just offering some thoughts from the other side. 

I wonder if there is a way to recapture some kind of feeling of innocence by sharing a new experience, together, that has the air of discovery about it. Like what we just did. That was new and different for us, and it felt innocent in a way. 

Blake (the famous poet) wrote a book of poems called *Songs of Innocence and Experience*. Innocence and experience being opposites.  

My god, I wish I had less experience too. Just like you wish you never experienced this level of betrayal, I wish I had never learned what betraying and lying to my partner feels like (pretty awful by the way).  

My husband also says that he wants to have a purely positive romantic experience with someone (and right now our relationship naturally comes with a lot of baggage and triggers etc.), one without any negative associations attached. 

Actually, when I write it like that...it sounds like an affair. Where you only present the good parts of yourselves and don't have to deal with the complications and difficulties of life. An escape from the pain, but not an experience of a real relationship. I don't think there is any way to have that without using and being used by someone in the process. It wouldn't be real love, so I doubt it would have the healing effects being sought. It takes so much time to build the kind of love and intimacy that could create the kind of truly corrective. 

Anyone who would sleep with you in a short amount of time would have issues driving them more than desire for you. They can't want you, the real you, without knowing you. 

Anything brief, the validation would be equally brief. Anything shallow, the validation would be equally shallow. Again, like an affair.

What I believe, by logic and in my heart, is that it would be most corrective for me to be the new person who only wants him (already true) and for our relationship to be the new, positive one (working on it). 

There is no quick way to resolve feelings of loss. Grieving takes time. 

This sounds like the bargaining stage of grief. I'm not sure it will hurt any less, maybe for five minutes, but it won't resolve what was lost. We can't get it back from anywhere. 

I'm sorry, that is bleak. 

I think the best way to deal with feelings of loss is to grieve them, not try to recapture through artificial means something that is normally organic and takes time to grow. 

I suppose it seems rich for me to be the one opining on the singular virtues of married love, but my experiences have taught me that *nothing else can ever compare*. So why waste any time on it?

An affair, a ONS, a hall pass, a side relationship--none of that will be deeply emotionally satisfying. I don't think it will work the way you guys think or hope it would. 

Some people need to make their own mistakes to really learn. I just wish you would save yourself the loss of that innocence too. Casual sex, in any form, is meaningless and degrading. And I don't think a person can experience a real and deep partnership relationship with someone else while still married. Right?

It makes more sense to me to focus on transforming our relationship into one that is affirming, that is validating, that is adventurous, that is deeply bonded, that meets both our needs, that meets his needs.

The question to me should be how can we care for and address his feelings of loss and whatever is lacking? And I think there is no quick fix for that. It will take time--and a multitude of corrective experiences together--to build something that will feel the way he wants to feel. Totally loved and valued and cherished. I didn't do that before. Big mistake. I think I can do it now. I will try. I am not deterred. 

Basically, to me this points to the fact that he needs more validation *from me*, more excitement *with me*, more positivity *from me*, more professions and demonstrations of love *from me*, to overcome the valid doubts and insecurities caused by having done the opposite for so long. Only effort over time and can accomplish that. And the immense amount of time, effort and commitment it will take to accomplish that in itself would be one long grand gesture, years in the making. Who else would do that for you except someone who really loves you for you and wants to be only with you? 

I'm not arguing with you. Talking to myself really. Asking myself how can I do that? Not so that he won't want to leave me or be with someone else, but so that he actually feels good being with me, despite all the shit we've been through, that he is happy and has (almost) no doubts. The way he would feel in a normal happy marriage. That is what I want for myself and for him. 

Lastly, I don't think she needed another person to feel fulfilled. I doubt it worked at all. If it had been so fulfilling, she'd be long gone, right? Not regretful and trying to rebuild with you, the Chosen One. Choosing you now and every day after, and remembering the period of time where she didn't do that as the biggest, most deeply regretted mistake of her life.",Be respectful,incivility,False

“A report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development has found that just under 553,000 people are homeless, with approximately 65% staying in sheltered accommodation. Out of every 10,000 people in the United States, 17 experienced homelessness on a single night in 2018.” [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/12/20/the-u-s-cities-with-the-most-homeless-people-in-2018-infographic/amp/) Thats a whopping .16% of the American population that is homeless, so don’t try and play this as a massive failure of the system. 

2nd, I’ve seen this comparison before... what is a “modest 2 bedroom home” and why is that benchmark? Why not throw in a car while you’re at it. If anything the benchmark should be “any permanent accommodation.” That $21.25 is an inflated number to purposely mislead the real cost to live in an area. 

Also no one is shackling these people people to San Francisco. If they can’t afford to live there THEN MOVE. I pay $925/month for a 3 bedroom 1500sqft house (that’s $5.50/hr to pay for that), if I lived in LA it would be $2200+/month.

How many times have you felt victimized by the other men who spew hatred and violence? *That's* toxic masculinity and it ties a whole lot into misandry.

Her stake president had very specific quotes from a wide array of her public and private social media accounts over a broad range of time. I find it highly unlikely that he was following her that closely for that long of a period, especially since she moved out of his stake several years ago. I suspect the SCMC gave him a dossier on Natasha and instructed him to act upon that information. \n\n2. I find it odd that her stake president suddenly decided to hold a council after she had been gone for almost a couple years.

Did he confront her about the statements prior, or did he ignore them and all of a sudden wait 2 years after she left his stake to ex her?

Only three counties — none in the Bay Area — remain in the most restrictive purple tier of California’s pandemic reopening plan.\n\n>The four Bay Area counties in the red tier, the second most restrictive, could all move to orange next week. Only Sonoma County is currently meeting the state’s orange tier metrics, but the other three — Contra Costa, Napa and Solano — could move too, based on an expected readjustment to the metrics tied to vaccine equity.\n\n>The new metrics could also allow San Francisco to move to the least-restrictive yellow tier a bit faster, though the earliest it would be eligible is April 13.\n\n>Sonoma County, which had been stuck in the purple tier for more than six months before moving to red three weeks ago, is poised to move into orange on Tuesday unless its numbers suddenly tank — as happened with Napa County last week, when it just missed moving to the orange tier.\n\n>“It’s hard to predict for sure, but at the moment, it looks likely that we’re on track to enter orange tier sometime next week,” said Kim Holden, a spokesperson for the county’s Public Health Department.\n\n>The move would mean wineries could open indoor tasting rooms and bars, and music and sports venues could open outdoors with limits. Sonoma County would join San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Alameda and Santa Clara counties in the orange tier. The state announces new tier assignments every Tuesday, and the relaxed restrictions take effect on Wednesday.\n\n>The three other Bay Area counties that remain in the red tier don’t currently meet metrics to move to orange. But they will once the state readjusts those metrics.\n\n>California announced a plan in early March tying the number of vaccinations in low-income communities to an accelerated reopening system. The tier assignments already were loosened once, when the state reached 2 million vaccinations in those communities. They will be further loosened when the state hits 4 million vaccinations.\n\n>As of Friday the state was at 3.7 million vaccinations in low-income communities. “It’s very possible that sometime next week we will be crossing that (4 million) threshold,” said Dr. Tomás Aragón, the state health officer, on Friday.\n\n>Currently, counties need to report fewer than 3.9 cases per 100,000 residents, adjusted based on the amount of testing they do, to move to the orange tier. Contra Costa, Napa and Solano counties are all above that rate. But when the metrics are readjusted, the new maximum case rate for the orange tier will be 5.9 per 100,000. All three counties meet that metric.\n\n>“We are currently holding steady and well within the red tier at 5.5 cases per day per 100,000, and especially so when the state closes in on the 4 million doses,” said Shai Davis, a spokesperson for Solano County’s health department. “We aim to see a downward trend in daily new cases and be able to progress to the orange tier when eligible.”\n\n>The tier adjustments also would lower the case rate for the yellow tier — from 1 case per 100,000 currently to under 2 cases per 100,000. San Francisco is meeting the second goal, but under state rules it must remain in the orange tier for at least one more week before moving to yellow.\n\n>Despite the encouraging signs, the Solano County Department of Health and Social Services on Thursday urged residents to continue to adhere to coronavirus mitigation measures through the upcoming religious and spring break holidays, noting an uptick of new cases.\n\n>“The rising number of COVID-19 cases is concerning, especially as we approach the holidays where the risk of spread can increase,” said Dr. Bela Matyas, the county’s health officer, in a statement. “Being in the red tier does not mean we can let our guard down.”\n\n>Santa Clara County’s public health officials also cautioned vigilance as they are continuing to see increases in the number and proportion of confirmed cases of coronavirus variants.\n\n>“We’re already seeing surges in other parts of the country, likely driven by variants. Combined with the data we are seeing locally, these are important warning signs that we must continue to minimize the spread,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County health officer.\n\n>As of last week, every variant of concern has been detected in Santa Clara County, including variants that are more infectious and may be partially resistant to vaccines. Officials said the county continues to face inadequate vaccine supply.\n\n>“If we can’t get more supply, and continued adherence to behavior like wearing masks, then we do anticipate another surge. I would hope it would be a swell, not a surge,” Cody said. She defined a swell as a less intense surge.\n\n>“We need people to hold on just a little bit longer,” she said. “Don’t indoor dine, don’t host an indoor gathering, don’t travel.

These changes among others would fundamentally alter the market dynamics that would undermine UBI. \n\nOf course, put this way, it becomes a part of a broader political question, rather than a technical one that you raise in your post."", "">Most markets aren't California though. There is already a housing shortage here. That shortage is for a combination of reasons but it absolutely constitutes and uncompetitive market. \n\nYou are right that there is a shortage but there is plenty of competition in the housing market in California.  There are thousands of landlords and millions of home owners in California.   \n\n>Landlords can easily raise rent and still jeep buildings filled. Before the pandemic skewed statistics The average rent in the ten zip codes with the highest poverty rates in the Bay Area have gone up 67% since 2012. The landlords could already demand more from people before, they know these people will have more money, and they will raise rents to capture it. \n\nSome landlords might try to raise rent significantly when it is first put into place but it seems pretty unlikely that a significant increase caused by UBI would remain over the long-term.  Housing prices are increasing in large part because most jobs are located in the cities.  If UBI existed, tons of people would move out to lower COL areas since their COL would decrease more than their paycheck would.  Tons of jobs would be created in those areas since more people would be there and they would have more money to spend.  \n\nSince demand in currently high-demand areas would decrease and lower COL areas (generally speaking) can easily build housing, landlords and property owners would have a very hard time pushing up prices over the long-term.  \n\n>The initial review by the Energy Commission said that California gasoline prices have “diverged noticeably from U.S. averages” beginning in 2015 when an explosion at the Torrance refinery interrupted supplies. “While that outage lasted roughly one and a half years, the increase in California gasoline prices remained well after the restoration of normal operations at Torrance,” the report said.  Once the gas industry realized it could still move the same amount of gasoline at a higher price point they never brought the price down because it is a lot harder to buy a brand new fuel efficient or electric car than it is to allocate more of your budget to fuel. \n\nThe report didn't conclude that major gasoline suppliers artificially increasing prices causing the gas prices to stay up.  Even if it did, I don't see how that would be a good argument against UBI.  If consumer spending increased by 10% due to higher wages rather than UBI, the gasoline prices would go up by the same amount.  UBI isn't supposed to replace government regulation.  \n\n>The more inelastic a good or service is the more they can increase prices without fearing competition. \n\nInelasticity can lead to higher price increases if there is not sufficient competition.  An inelastic market does not necessarily have higher prices than an elastic market.""]",">Landlords can easily raise rent and still jeep buildings filled.

Attempts have been made to offer $15-20/hour for pickers, but the problem is that nobody wants to do those jobs for any price because it requires following harvests around the growing states as different crops come to maturity, and there's zero chance of any kind of advancement in career or job status. Not only that, but there's no work at all during the non-growing months and seasons, so it's at best part time seasonal work that requires you pay for your  own vehicle and gas to get around. Even state prisoners refused to participate in picking jobs, and that's saying a lot.

I’d say it straddles the border of where a card should be banned, it’s just a matter of debate on which side it’s on.\n\nBeyond that, thank you for saying we have to wait and see. Power is contextual, and the better players are always able to recognize meta and the pilot are some of the biggest factors, not a Card’s innate power', '> It’s more or less a ~~weird~~ **very powerful** version of Drawn from Dreams.\n\nInstant speed is the way to be able to play around counters, and the ability for it to cost less matters a lot. Drawn from Dreams will never see eternal play. DDT sees it all the time. Mid game the card will almost always cost UU only. \n\nI think, though, that in Pioneer DDT is only good in other types of shells that fill the yard quickly, and likely only as a 2 or 3 of. I played against an Izzet Burn/Gearhulk tempo deck that was quite well constructed. If I didn\'t kill him by turn 5 or 6 I would lose. They even turned the corner with 1 life left and I couldn\'t get around. It was a wild game, a great shell for the card. \n\nAgain, I don\'t know that its ban worthy, like you said power is contextual. In that shell, but the fact that it doesn\'t just seem to be in every list that runs blue, it proves your point. \n\nAgain, not calling for a ban here, but lets contrast this with Oko. If a deck is Simic, it is running Oko if it is an optimized list. If a deck is Green in any way other than ramp/devotion, it is most likely splashing blue to include Oko or it at least heavily considers doing so. That\'s the main difference it power level here. DDT you don\'t just auto include, Oko you do. \n\nIts indicative of something unhealthy, but like with DDT its probably too early to determine if a deck has a hugely advantageous winning percentage just for running a certain card (WotC are the only folks with access to this data these days). The lack of health that results from it may just need time for the meta to correct, or it may need artificial adjustment.\n\nI always err on the side of ""let the meta sort it out."" and I actually think WotC made the right call on waiting during Eldrazi Winter in modern, and that was literally the definition of a ban worthy meta game. I think they took the right action on KCI, and though they eventually banned faithless looting and that was probably correct (even though I was super sad since I can\'t remember the last time I brewed a deck without Looting), they screwed up by banning Bridge from Below earlier and that card needs to be taken off the list. \n\nBut they took their time and tried to get the least impactful card first, which was the right MO even if it resulted in the wrong card being banned.

Donna Edwards (D-MD) told NASA administrator Charles Bolden during a House Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing on Wednesday afternoon. “I wonder if you can tell me how we can expect support on this committee for an 104% increase when you have yet to provide to us, despite being asked numerous times, frankly, General, a credible cost and schedule estimate that justifies an annual funding stream.”

Does this not remind you what is happening with HLS? i.e. Senate provided more funding than House, but still below requested level. And House democrats keep asking ""where is the schedule, where is the plan"" blah blah, even though there is already a plan and schedule. And of course 2012 was also an election year, and a few months after this article was published SpaceX successfully completed Dragon C2+ mission and became the first private company to dock a spacecraft with ISS, which gave the commercial space advocates a big boost in the fight in congress.

In other words, of those full-time employees working at least 60h/week, and thus most likely to be considered for leadership roles, only 18% are women.\n\nSince working extra hours is a prerequisite to leadership roles, assuming men and women are equally skilled and there's no other factors, you'd only expect 18% of people in leadership roles to be women.\n\nAnd this is without taking into account that more men than women are even in full-time employment.

Akira Kurosawa\'s movie ""Ikiru"" (Life) presents a view into japanese work ethics, it\'s not directly related to any of these issues, but is a great movie.\n\nMy introduction with the company culture is from a Norwegian friend who lived there with her Japanese man and their child for a few years. She was used to rather much gender equality, earning her own money, and described the company culture of her SO as exhausting for them both, she didn\'t find any opportunities to work (having a kid), and he spent more hours than he was comfortable with at work or out drinking with his boss and colleagues. After some time, she couldn\'t do that lonely lifestyle, and moved back to Norway with the kid.\n\nEdit: I also did some maths on the numbers in the article, he gets 243£ per month, which is described as 8.8% of the monthly budget. I almost found myself and my family in a similar financial situation this summer and did some of the budgeting, I\'d end up with less pocket money for myself.

Sometimes you get off the line, sometimes you take the line, sometimes you make a new line, sometimes you erase the line. 

Getting off the line is the first thing, because as a newbie, it is likely all you can do and is more fault tolerant than other solutions. Being able to avoid, get ahold of, and redirect incoming forces and momentum is part of the gig; getting out of the way is the first level. Against someone who will track you it only provides a momentary solution, as the video shows.

Taking the line is very much a weapons thing that also applies to unarmed conflict. Two solid objects cannot occupy the same space. Possess the space and you possess the encounter. Taking the line, armed or unarmed, takes control of the space directly between you (the fastest and shortest route between pointy bits and meat), it displaces uke’s body or weapon in the process as one enters.

Making a new line is geometry and whether it is stepping while altering the direction of the point of contact, slipping an attack and entering, or some other form of diverging contact. It is an alteration in the conflict space geometry.

Erasing the line would be total paradigm shift. Absorb the line of attack, wrap around, and smother. Splitting the line of attack might belong here, sticky may fall into this category, though sticky often turns the line into a spiral.

Given time and desire, I am sure we can come up with an exhaustive list of pure and hybrid variations under these classifications and create names for each; or maybe not. Big lists of classified things are for collectors and organizers, not really my thing. 

Getting off the line has received a lot crap in the last few years. But expertise does not spring fully formed from the wellhead of new students. The untrained should not stand in front of a determined mass of moving meat bent on mayhem. If all you are doing after years of training is getting off the line, then you are stuck in grade school. It is all about developmental steps.",Polite and Respectful Discourse,incivility,False

Again, for me, the self-imposed challenges are what I come back for. But this shit Capcom does where it imposes what I'M ""supposed"" believe (or care about) with regards to types of difficulty and how it manifests in such a shitty way is just fucking irritating.

I wont tell exactly what it was since its quite personal, but this event shook me and everything i believed in. After the event, i slowly started to doubt everything, including my own beliefs. It took me about 3 years to change my views. These years were pretty grim, and so were my views on the beliefs i used to have. There was no proper train of thought behind my change of views. It was rather a thing of wanting to leave behind the past and my old self with it. And with that (plus meeting several new people and learning about the world) i started to adopt new views and beliefs.  \n\n\nWhen it comes specifically to LGBTQ, its the latest thing i decided to support after thinking about it like this:  \nSociety evolves in a certain direction, it always has and always will be, there is nothing we can do about that. What we can do is change our approach to it. I would compare LGBTQ to womens sufferage. At the time, there were people who supported womens sufferage , and there were people against. Today , if youre a normal person, you know that women having equal rights is a great thing and people in the past that protested it werent right. Its same with racial equality for example.   \n\n\nSo when it comes to LGBTQ, i think that they are just like the people in the past, seeking to be equal before law and fully recognized by society. And I also think that in the future people will consider LGBTQ a great thing. Also one other thing is, i thought ""If i was gay, or bisexual, or didnt feel right in my own body and decided to go transgender, i would greatly appreciate if people who are heterosexual considered me normal and supported my cause"" besides, nobody chooses to be born gay or heterosexual, just like nobody chooses to be born man or woman, black or white. That is why we should all be the same no matter who we are, and to have the priviledge to be the exact person we decide to be, is a priviledge of a developed, democratic first world country, that we should be proud of.   \n\n\nI wrote this pretty tired so apologies if there are some inconsitencies or grammar mistakes.   \n\n\nAlso a disclaimer: I do not support the things like ""pedophilia is a sexuality"" or anything similar.']",Thx for the honest answer,No Personal Attacks,harassment,False

In AL right now, if a player builds a legal character and completes a legal session, the player will **ALWAYS** receive league defined rewards.

This change is suggesting that between three different DMs, all running the same adventure in the exact same way, can all arbitrarily decide differently when their players level up.  Leveling up can legally be inconsistent between otherwise identical tables. 

There is no AL precedence for this type of table disparity. Sure, AL has struggled with how to pace hardcovers, but always strove for a semblance of consistency. The leveling up rules operated the same for you, me, and everyone. 

DM subjective milestone means legally allowing leveling up to work differently for Table 1 than it does for Table 2, for no discernable reason.

Even many ATGM hits on modern tanks do not cause complete destruction of the vehicle. Especially if the fire is extinguished and there wasn't much of a cookoff. On the other hand, these aren't modern tanks.\n\nA lot of damage can be repaired and electronics can be replaced so the tank can be returned to service, even with the small hole in it's armor. In previous wars, Israel has retrofitted hundreds of hit tanks.\n\nIn 2006 war about 40 Israeli tanks were penetrated, but only 2-3 of those were completely destroyed.

However, I believe you\'re scientifically incorrect regarding LDL. \n\nAs we get more data or better measuring tools we develop more or new insights. At the beginning, we were only able to measure total blood cholesterol. Then we started separating cholesterol by their density (LDL, HDL, etc) using electrophoresis. Then genetics studies, knock-out animals, familial lipid disorders and epidemiological studies shed more light. Now we know the problem is not LDL-C (concentration) but LDL-P (particle number) or a combination of both. Take a look at the 2 papers I referenced above. The data is very strong for LDL as a causative for atherosclerosis. You might still disagree but the scientific data is very strong. \n\nNow to your points: \n\n>Actually keto diets can have as little or as much fiber as you want.\n\nCorrect, but most keto diets are low in fiber. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Personally, I don\'t think there is any good reason to eat fiber, I also wrote up a wiki at [r/ketoscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/) you can find -\n\nThe 2 main reasons to eat fiber is (1) to lower cholesterol; (2) reduce your blood glucose peak.

A keto diet based on bacon and processed meat is probably as bad as the standard american diet.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> There is no reason to careful, there is reason to question everything you eat. \n\nWhy not?

I also assumed you didn\'t read my 2 reviews I provided in my answer above. Your statement has some flaws. First, we need to talk about LDL particles not LDLC. Particles are the ones crossing, not concentration. Second, there\'s no crossing of the arterial wall. The LDL-P crosses the endothelium and stays in the arterial wall. Here is the scientific evidence of how this happens for this [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167422/):\n\n>A number of studies have recently demonstrated that low density lipoprotein (LDL) transcytosis across the endothelium is dependent on the function of caveolae, scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), and LDL receptor (LDLR)...\n\nThere you have the mechanism and more is explained in the review. \n\nYou\'re entitled to your opinion but you\'re giving **dangerous** advice regarding LDL.', ""> The 2 main reasons to eat fiber is (1) to lower cholesterol; (2) reduce your blood glucose peak.

Start by chilling your material columns. With open sleeved jackets a dry ice/ 99% isopropyl solution will reach -110, and with closed jackets liquid nitrogen is appropriate. Chill the solvent tank at this time as well.\n2. Once you have reached and are holding desired temp while also maintaining vacuum it’s time to prime the system. We do this by pushing warm vapors from another solvent tank into the system.\n3. Turn on your recovery pump and open recovery port on your cold tank, allow it to build a bit of pressure. While doing this, remove the cold solvent tank from its chilling bath, place it on your refrigerant scale, then open the liquid port and begin flushing. I do a 10:1 solvent to material.\n4. Once the solvent has pushed through the material column I let the solute run through my buchner vessel (purchased from open source Steel). I put pro pak distillation packing on top and between the filters to prevent clogging. Freeze with dry ice and iso/etoh for at least one hour. I’ve had clients get good results without dewaxing.\n5. After allotted time, I open the next valve and allow it to run through the filters into the collection vessel. I recover at 65° to preserve the terps.\n6. Once it’s low enough open (you want to leave about 1lb of solvent and pour into jars put lid on loose and cryo with dry ice / isopropyl for minimum of 2 days. I do this in an igloo cooler in a deep freeze freezer. During this you’ll see THCa crystals blooming on the walls and bottom of the jars. This is what you want to happen, don’t be alarmed.\n7. After that let jars sit at room temp for an hour or 2, then tighten the lids all the way and do another couple hours at room temp. (This is only to ensure enough solvent has evaporated so you can tighten the lid)\n8. Place jars, with lids tight, in vacuum oven at 80-85° with no vacuum, for 14-21 days, sometimes longer depending on the reaction. (For larger diamonds set to 65° this will extend growth time to 3 months even longer. You must be patient for this. I advise doing 85° till youre comfortable.) That’s when your crystals will grow and real separation will happen.\n9. Once you feel you have achieved proper separation. (You sometimes need to burp after growth has stopped) Open jar and quickly pour terps into smaller jar allow some diamonds to flow in as well. Cap and place back on heat for another week or 2 to ensure precipitation has ended.\n10. After a week or 2 open terp fraction and begin purging. Leave the oven at 85(this step is not always necessary), pour the terps into a pyrex dish to allow for enough surface area for the solvent to escape. And pull a -15 to -20 vac for 4 days\n11. While the terp fraction is finishing we advise to put the thca portion in the freezer with capped lid. Place back in oven and purge with the terpene fraction.\n\nThe freezing in the jars will force the THCa to crystallize and crash off to the bottom. Then, as it heats up it will dissolve (if you have no pressure it will float to the top leaving seeds everywhere negating the cryo) with pressure it will stay at the bottom and create a clear layer and as the pressure rises the layer gets thinner and more compact until it’s so compact it’s forced to crystallize to get room…']",Thanks for sharing!
